ðŸ’š First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ’š

Anyone is welcome to join in the effort, regardless of technical experience or 
familiarity with the Electron project.

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable
behavior to electron@github.com.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Electron's localization
effort. These are just guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgment and 
feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Translating

ðŸ‘‰ **Do not translate the content directly in this repository!**

Electron's localization effort uses [Crowdin], an awesome platform for 
collaborative translation. Changes on Crowdin are  automatically turned into 
pull requests on this GitHub repository.

To get started, visit 
**[crowdin.com/project/electron](https://crowdin.com/project/electron)** 
and log in with your GitHub account.

## Developing `electron-i18n`

The rest of this document describes how this repo is structured, how
it syncs with Crowdin, and how to make technical changes.

**If you're just here to translate, you probably don't need to read this.**

### Environment Setup

To fetch the latest docs, you need a GitHub token. Visit
github.com/settings/tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
to create one. No special scopes needed.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your token. 

```sh
npm run build
```

### Source Content

Electron's documentation and website are authored in English.

The source content in this repo is collected from a few places:

- Markdown files from the [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/master/docs) repo.
- YAML files from the [electronjs.org](https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org/blob/master/data/locale.yml) repo
- Electron's [structured API docs](https://electronjs.org/blog/api-docs-json-schema).

Here's the directory structure:

```
content
â””â”€â”€ en
    â”œâ”€â”€ api
    â”œâ”€â”€ docs
    â””â”€â”€ website
```

### Translated Content

[The Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/electron) is configured to automatically **pull** the latest English content out of this repo and **push** the translated content back into this repo.

Translations are added under a directory named after the locale. The _contents_ of these files differ by language, but the _directory structure and filenames_ for each locale is always identical.

```

â”œâ”€â”€ en
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ api
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ docs
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ website
â”œâ”€â”€ es
