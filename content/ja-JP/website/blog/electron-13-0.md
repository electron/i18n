## End of Support for 10.x.y

Electron 10.x.y has reached end-of-support as per the project's [support policy](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#supported-versions). Developers and applications are encouraged to upgrade to a newer version of Electron.

## What's Next

In the short term, you can expect the team to continue to focus on keeping up with the development of the major components that make up Electron, including Chromium, Node, and V8. Although we are careful not to make promises about release dates, our plan is release new major versions of Electron with new versions of those components approximately quarterly. The [tentative 14.0.0 schedule](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/electron-timelines) maps out key dates in the Electron 14.0 development life cycle. Also, [see our versioning document](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/electron-versioning) for more detailed information about versioning in Electron.
