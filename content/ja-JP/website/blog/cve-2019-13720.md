## Scope

This affects any Electron application that may run third-party or untrusted JavaScript.

## Mitigation

Affected apps should upgrade to a patched version of Electron.

We've published new versions of Electron which include fixes for this vulnerability:
  * [6.1.4](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v6.1.4)

Electron 7.0.1 automatically included the fix from upstream, before the announcement was made. Electron 8 is similarly unaffected. The vulnerability did not exist in Electron 5, so that version is also unaffected.

## Further Information

This vulnerability was discovered by Anton Ivanov and Alexey Kulaev at Kaspersky Labs and reported to the Chrome team. The Chrome blog post can be found [here](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2019/10/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_31.html).
