# Bắt đầu nhanh

Electron enables you to create desktop applications with pure JavaScript by providing a runtime with rich native (operating system) APIs. 웹 서버 대신 데스크탑 애플리케이션에 초점을 맞춘 Node.js 런타임의 변종이라고 생각하시면 됩니다.

The old "Quick Start" document that used to live here has been split up into two documents:

* To check out how a simple Electron app is built, see [Writing Your First Electron App](./first-app.md)
* To check out the process architecture, see [Main and Renderer Processes](./application-architecture.md#main-and-renderer-processes).

To learn more about Electron, check out the [official guides](../).
