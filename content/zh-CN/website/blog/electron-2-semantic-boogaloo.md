A new major version of Electron is in the works, and with it some changes to our versioning strategy. As of version 2.0.0, Electron will strictly adhere to Semantic Versioning.

---

This change means you'll see the major version bump more often, and it will usually be a major update to Chromium. Patch releases will also be more stable, as they will now only contain bug fixes with no new features.

**Major 版本增量**

* Chromium 版本更新
* Node.js 重大版本更新
* Electron 突破性 API 变更

**Minor 版本增量**

* Node.js 次要版本更新
* Electron 无突破性 API 变更

**Patch 版本增量**

* Node.js patch 版本更新
* 修复相关的 chromium 补丁
* Electron bug fixes

Because Electron's semver ranges will now be more meaningful, we recommend installing Electron using npm's default `--save-dev` flag, which will prefix your version with `^`, keeping you safely up to date with minor and patch updates:

```sh
npm install --save-dev electron
```

For developers interested only in bug fixes, you should use the tilde semver prefix e.g. `~2.0.0`, which which will never introduce new features, only fixes to improve stability.
