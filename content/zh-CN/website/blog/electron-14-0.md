## 重大更改

Below are breaking changes introduced in Electron 14. More information about these and future changes can be found on the [Planned Breaking Changes](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/breaking-changes.md) page.

### 已移除： `app.allowRendererProcessReuse`

The `app.allowRendererProcessReuse` property has been removed as part of our plan to more closely align with Chromium's process model for security, performance and maintainability.

For more detailed information see [#18397](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/18397).

### Removed: Browser Window Affinity

The `affinity` option when constructing a new `BrowserWindow` has been removed as part of our plan to more closely align with Chromium's process model for security, performance and maintainability.

For more detailed information see [#18397](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/18397).

### API 更改： `window.open()`

The optional parameter `frameName` no longer sets the title of the window. This behavior now follows the specification described by the [native documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open#parameters) for the `windowName` parameter.

If you were using this parameter to set the title of a window, you can instead use the [`win.setTitle(title)`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window#winsettitletitle) method.

### 已移除： `worldSafeExecuteJavaScript`

`worldSafeExecuteJavaScript` has been removed with no alternative. Please ensure your code works with this property enabled. It has been enabled by default since Electron 12.

若您使用了 `webFrame.executeJavaScript` 或 `webFrame.executeJavaScriptInIsolatedWorld`，这个改动会对您造成影响。 您需要保证 [Context Bridge API](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/context-bridge.md#parameter--error--return-type-support) 支持这些方法的返回值，因为这些方法使用相同的值传递语义。

### 默认更改： `nativeWindowOpen` 默认为 `true`

Prior to Electron 14, `window.open` was by default shimmed to use `BrowserWindowProxy`. This meant that `window.open('about:blank')` did not work to open synchronously scriptable child windows, among other incompatibilities. `nativeWindowOpen` is no longer experimental, and is now the default.

See the documentation for [window.open in Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/window-open.md) for more details.

### Removed: BrowserWindowConstructorOptions inheriting from parent windows

Prior to Electron 14, windows opened with `window.open` would inherit BrowserWindow constructor options such as `transparent` and `resizable` from their parent window. Beginning with Electron 14, this behavior has been removed and windows will not inherit any BrowserWindow constructor options from their parents.

Instead, explicitly set options for the new window with `setWindowOpenHandler`:

```js
webContents.setWindowOpenHandler((details) => {
  return {
    action: 'allow',
    overrideBrowserWindowOptions: {
      // ...
    }
  }
})
```

### 已移除： `additionalFeatures`

The deprecated `additionalFeatures` property in the `new-window` and `did-create-window` events of WebContents has been removed. Since `new-window` uses positional arguments, the argument is still present, but will always be the empty array `[]`. (Note: the `new-window` event itself is already deprecated and has been replaced by `setWindowOpenHandler`.) Bare keys in window features will now present as keys with the value `true` in the options object.

```js
// Removed in Electron 14
// Triggered by window.open('...', '', 'my-key')
webContents.on('did-create-window', (window, details) => {
  if (details.additionalFeatures.includes('my-key')) {
    // ...
  }
})

// Replace with
webContents.on('did-create-window', (window, details) => {
  if (details.options['my-key']) {
    // ...
  }
})
```

### Removed: `remote` module

Deprecated in Electron 12, the `remote` module has now been removed from Electron itself and extracted into a separate package, [`@electron/remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@electron/remote). The `@electron/remote` module bridges JavaScript objects from the main process to the renderer process. This lets you access main-process-only objects as if they were available in the renderer process. This is a direct replacement for the `remote` module. See the [module's readme](https://github.com/electron/remote/blob/main/README.md) for migration instructions and reference.


## API 更改

* Added `BrowserWindow.isFocusable()` method to determine whether a window is focusable. [#28642](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/28642)
* Added `WebFrameMain.visibilityState` instance property. [#28706](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/28706)
* Added `disposition`, `referrer` and `postBody` to the details object passed to the window open handler registered with `setWindowOpenHandler`. [#28518](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/28518)
* Added `process.contextId` used by `@electron/remote`. [#28007](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/28007)
* Added experimental cookie encryption support behind an [Electron Fuse](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/fuses). [#29492](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/29492)
* Added missing `resourceType` conversions for `webRequest` listener details: `font`, `ping`, `cspReport`, `media`, `webSocket`. [#30050](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/30050)
* Added new `session.storagePath` API to get the path on disk for session-specific data. [#28665](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/28665)
* Added support for Windows Control Overlay on macOS. [#29986](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/29986)
* Added support for directing Chromium logging to a file with `--log-file=.../path/to/file.log`. Also, it's now possible to enable logging from JavaScript by appending command-line switches during the first JS tick. [#29963](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/29963)
* Added support for the des-ede3 cipher in node crypto. [#27897](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/27897)
* Added a `ContextBridgeMutability` feature that allows context bridge objects to be mutated. [#27348](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/27348)


### Removed/Deprecated Changes

The following APIs have been removed or are now deprecated:

* The `remote` module has been removed after being deprecated in Electron 12. [#25734](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25734)
* Child windows no longer inherit BrowserWindow construction options from their parents. [#28550](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/28550)
* Removed deprecated `additionalFeatures` property from `new-window` and `did-create-window` WebContents events. [#28548](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/28548)
* Removed the deprecated `app.allowRendererProcessReuse` and BrowserWindow `affinity` options. [#26874](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/26874)
* The `submitURL` option for `crashReporter.start` is no longer a required argument when `uploadToServer` is false. [#28105](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/28105)

## End of Support for 11.x.y

Electron 11.x.y has reached end-of-support as per the project's [support policy](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#supported-versions). Developers and applications are encouraged to upgrade to a newer version of Electron.

## What's Next

In the short term, you can expect the team to continue to focus on keeping up with the development of the major components that make up Electron, including Chromium, Node, and V8. Although we are careful not to make promises about release dates, our plan is release new major versions of Electron with new versions of those components approximately quarterly.
