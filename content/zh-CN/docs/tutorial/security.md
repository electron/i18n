# 安全性，原生能力和你的责任

Web开发人员通常享有浏览器强大的网络安全特性，而自己的代码风险相对较小。 我们的网站从沙箱获得有限权限。我们坚信用户可以享受一个大的工程师团队构建的浏览器，因为他们能够快速响应新发现的安全威胁。

当使用 Electron 时，很重要的一点是要理解 Electron 不是一个 Web 浏览器。 它允许您使用熟悉的 Web 技术构建功能丰富的桌面应用程序，但是您的代码具有更强大的功能。 JavaScript 可以访问文件系统，用户 shell 等。 这允许您构建更高质量的本机应用程序，但是内在的安全风险会随着授予您的代码的额外权力而增加。

考虑到这一点，请注意，展示任意来自不受信任源的内容都将会带来严重的安全风险，而这种风险Electron也没打算处理。 事实上，最流行的 Electron 应用程序(Atom，Slack，Visual Studio Code 等) 主要显示本地内容(即使有远程内容也是无 Node 的、受信任的、安全的内容) - 如果您的应用程序要运行在线的源代码，那么您需要确保源代码不是恶意的。

## 报告安全问题

有关如何正确上报 Electron 漏洞的信息，参阅 [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/master/SECURITY.md)

## Chromium 安全问题和升级

尽管 Electron 努力尽快支持新版本的 Chromium，但开发人员应该意识到，升级是一项严肃的工作 - 涉及手动编辑几十个甚至几百个文件。 受限于当前可用的资源与贡献，Electron 通常不能保持使用最新版本的 Chromium，可能落后几周或几个月。

我们认为，我们当前的更新 Chromium 组件的系统在我们可用的资源和构建在框架之上的大多数应用程序的需求之间取得了适当的平衡。 我们绝对有兴趣听听更多关于在 Electron 上构建事物的人的具体用例。 非常欢迎提出请求并且捐助支持我们的努力。

## Security Is Everyone's Responsibility

It is important to remember that the security of your Electron application is the result of the overall security of the framework foundation (*Chromium*, *Node.js*), Electron itself, all NPM dependencies and your code. As such, it is your responsibility to follow a few important best practices:

* **Keep your application up-to-date with the latest Electron framework release.** When releasing your product, you’re also shipping a bundle composed of Electron, Chromium shared library and Node.js. Vulnerabilities affecting these components may impact the security of your application. By updating Electron to the latest version, you ensure that critical vulnerabilities (such as *nodeIntegration bypasses*) are already patched and cannot be exploited in your application.

* **Evaluate your dependencies.** While NPM provides half a million reusable packages, it is your responsibility to choose trusted 3rd-party libraries. If you use outdated libraries affected by known vulnerabilities or rely on poorly maintained code, your application security could be in jeopardy.

* **Adopt secure coding practices.** The first line of defense for your application is your own code. Common web vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), have a higher security impact on Electron applications hence it is highly recommended to adopt secure software development best practices and perform security testing.

## Isolation For Untrusted Content

A security issue exists whenever you receive code from an untrusted source (e.g. a remote server) and execute it locally. As an example, consider a remote website being displayed inside a default [`BrowserWindow`](../api/browser-window.md). If an attacker somehow manages to change said content (either by attacking the source directly, or by sitting between your app and the actual destination), they will be able to execute native code on the user's machine.

> :warning:无论如何，在启用Node.js集成的情况下，你都不该加载并执行远程代码。 相反，只使用本地文件（和您的应用打包在一起）来执行Node.js代码 To display remote content, use the [`<webview>`](../api/webview-tag.md) tag or [`BrowserView`](../api/browser-view.md), make sure to disable the `nodeIntegration` and enable `contextIsolation`.

## Electron 安全警告

From Electron 2.0 on, developers will see warnings and recommendations printed to the developer console. They only show up when the binary's name is Electron, indicating that a developer is currently looking at the console.

You can force-enable or force-disable these warnings by setting `ELECTRON_ENABLE_SECURITY_WARNINGS` or `ELECTRON_DISABLE_SECURITY_WARNINGS` on either `process.env` or the `window` object.

To automate the detection of misconfigurations and insecure patterns, it is possible to use [electronegativity](https://github.com/doyensec/electronegativity). For additional details on potential weaknesses and implementation bugs when developing applications using Electron, please refer to this [guide for developers and auditors](https://doyensec.com/resources/us-17-Carettoni-Electronegativity-A-Study-Of-Electron-Security-wp.pdf)

## 1) Only Load Secure Content

Any resources not included with your application should be loaded using a secure protocol like `HTTPS`. In other words, do not use insecure protocols like `HTTP`. Similarly, we recommend the use of `WSS` over `WS`, `FTPS` over `FTP`, and so on.

### 为什么？

`HTTPS` has three main benefits:

1) It authenticates the remote server, ensuring your app connects to the correct host instead of an impersonator. 2) It ensures data integrity, asserting that the data was not modified while in transit between your application and the host. 3) It encrypts the traffic between your user and the destination host, making it more difficult to eavesdrop on the information sent between your app and the host.

### 怎么做？

```js
// Bad
browserWindow.loadURL('http://example.com')

// Good
browserWindow.loadURL('https://example.com')
```

```html
<!-- Bad -->
<script crossorigin src="http://example.com/react.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://example.com/style.css">

<!-- Good -->
<script crossorigin src="https://example.com/react.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://example.com/style.css">
```

## 2) Disable Node.js Integration for Remote Content

It is paramount that you disable Node.js integration in any renderer ([`BrowserWindow`](../api/browser-window.md), [`BrowserView`](../api/browser-view.md), or [`<webview>`](../api/webview-tag.md)) that loads remote content. The goal is to limit the powers you grant to remote content, thus making it dramatically more difficult for an attacker to harm your users should they gain the ability to execute JavaScript on your website.

After this, you can grant additional permissions for specific hosts. For example, if you are opening a BrowserWindow pointed at `https://example.com/", you can give that website exactly the abilities it needs, but no more.

### 为什么？

A cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack is more dangerous if an attacker can jump out of the renderer process and execute code on the user's computer. Cross-site-scripting attacks are fairly common - and while an issue, their power is usually limited to messing with the website that they are executed on. Disabling Node.js integration helps prevent an XSS from being escalated into a so-called "Remote Code Execution" (RCE) attack.

### 怎么做？

```js
// Bad
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow()
mainWindow.loadURL('https://example.com')
```

```js
// Good
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  webPreferences: {
    nodeIntegration: false,
    nodeIntegrationInWorker: false,
    preload: './preload.js'
  }
})

mainWindow.loadURL('https://example.com')
```

```html
<!-- 不推荐 -->
<webview nodeIntegration src="page.html"></webview>

<!-- 推荐 -->
<webview src="page.html"></webview>
```

When disabling Node.js integration, you can still expose APIs to your website that do consume Node.js modules or features. Preload scripts continue to have access to `require` and other Node.js features, allowing developers to expose a custom API to remotely loaded content.

In the following example preload script, the later loaded website will have access to a `window.readConfig()` method, but no Node.js features.

```js
const { readFileSync } = require('fs')

window.readConfig = function () {
  const data = readFileSync('./config.json')
  return data
}
```

## 3) Enable Context Isolation for Remote Content

Context isolation is an Electron feature that allows developers to run code in preload scripts and in Electron APIs in a dedicated JavaScript context. In practice, that means that global objects like `Array.prototype.push` or `JSON.parse` cannot be modified by scripts running in the renderer process.

Electron uses the same technology as Chromium's [Content Scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts#execution-environment) to enable this behavior.

Even when you use `nodeIntegration: false` to enforce strong isolation and prevent the use of Node primitives, `contextIsolation` must also be used.

### 为什么？

Context isolation allows each the scripts on running in the renderer to make changes to its JavaScript environment without worrying about conflicting with the scripts in the Electron API or the preload script.

While still an experimental Electron feature, context isolation adds an additional layer of security. It creates a new JavaScript world for Electron APIs and preload scripts, which mitigates so-called "Prototype Pollution" attacks.

At the same time, preload scripts still have access to the `document` and `window` objects. In other words, you're getting a decent return on a likely very small investment.

### 怎么做？

```js
// 主进程
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  webPreferences: {
    contextIsolation: true,
    preload: 'preload.js'
  }
})
```

```js
// 预加载脚本

// 在页面加载前设置变量
webFrame.executeJavaScript('window.foo = "foo";')

// 这个变量仅限于当前上下文，被加载的页面将无权访问
window.bar = 'bar'

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // 结果为 'undefined'，因为 window.foo 仅在主上下文中可用
  console.log(window.foo)

  // 结果为 'bar'，因为 window.bar 定义在本上下文中
  console.log(window.bar)
})
```

## 4) Handle Session Permission Requests From Remote Content

You may have seen permission requests while using Chrome: They pop up whenever the website attempts to use a feature that the user has to manually approve ( like notifications).

The API is based on the [Chromium permissions API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/permissions) and implements the same types of permissions.

### 为什么？

By default, Electron will automatically approve all permission requests unless the developer has manually configured a custom handler. While a solid default, security-conscious developers might want to assume the very opposite.

### 怎么做？

```js
const { session } = require('electron')

session
  .fromPartition('some-partition')
  .setPermissionRequestHandler((webContents, permission, callback) => {
    const url = webContents.getURL()

    if (permission === 'notifications') {
      // Approves the permissions request
      callback(true)
    }

    // Verify URL
    if (!url.startsWith('https://example.com/')) {
      // Denies the permissions request
      return callback(false)
    }
  })
```

## 5) Do Not Disable WebSecurity

*Electron的默认值即是建议值。*

You may have already guessed that disabling the `webSecurity` property on a renderer process ([`BrowserWindow`](../api/browser-window.md), [`BrowserView`](../api/browser-view.md), or [`<webview>`](../api/webview-tag.md)) disables crucial security features.

Do not disable `webSecurity` in production applications.

### 为什么？

Disabling `webSecurity` will disable the same-origin policy and set `allowRunningInsecureContent` property to `true`. In other words, it allows the execution of insecure code from different domains.

### 怎么做？

```js
// 不推荐
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  webPreferences: {
    webSecurity: false
  }
})
```

```js
// 推荐
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow()
```

```html
<!-- 不推荐 -->
<webview disablewebsecurity src="page.html"></webview>

<!-- 推荐 -->
<webview src="page.html"></webview>
```

## 6) Define a Content Security Policy

A Content Security Policy (CSP) is an additional layer of protection against cross-site-scripting attacks and data injection attacks. We recommend that they be enabled by any website you load inside Electron.

### 为什么？

CSP allows the server serving content to restrict and control the resources Electron can load for that given web page. `https://example.com` should be allowed to load scripts from the origins you defined while scripts from `https://evil.attacker.com` should not be allowed to run. Defining a CSP is an easy way to improve your application's security.

The following CSP will allow Electron to execute scripts from the current website and from `apis.example.com`.

```txt
// Bad
Content-Security-Policy: '*'

// Good
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://apis.example.com
```

### CSP HTTP头

Electron respects the [`Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) which can be set using Electron's [`webRequest.onHeadersReceived`](../api/web-request.md#webrequestonheadersreceivedfilter-listener) handler:

```javascript
const { session } = require('electron')

session.defaultSession.webRequest.onHeadersReceived((details, callback) => {
  callback({
    responseHeaders: {
      ...details.responseHeaders,
      'Content-Security-Policy': ['default-src \'none\'']
    }
  })
})
```

### CSP元标签

CSP's preferred delivery mechanism is an HTTP header, however it is not possible to use this method when loading a resource using the `file://` protocol. It can be useful in some cases, such as using the `file://` protocol, to set a policy on a page directly in the markup using a `<meta>` tag:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none'">
```

#### `webRequest.onHeadersReceived([filter, ]listener)`

## 7) Do Not Set `allowRunningInsecureContent` to `true`

*Electron的默认值即是建议值。*

By default, Electron will not allow websites loaded over `HTTPS` to load and execute scripts, CSS, or plugins from insecure sources (`HTTP`). Setting the property `allowRunningInsecureContent` to `true` disables that protection.

Loading the initial HTML of a website over `HTTPS` and attempting to load subsequent resources via `HTTP` is also known as "mixed content".

### 为什么？

Loading content over `HTTPS` assures the authenticity and integrity of the loaded resources while encrypting the traffic itself. See the section on [only displaying secure content](#1-only-load-secure-content) for more details.

### 怎么做？

```js
// 不推荐
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  webPreferences: {
    allowRunningInsecureContent: true
  }
})
```

```js
// 推荐
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({})
```

## 8) Do Not Enable Experimental Features

*Electron的默认值即是建议值。*

Advanced users of Electron can enable experimental Chromium features using the `experimentalFeatures` property.

### 为什么？

Experimental features are, as the name suggests, experimental and have not been enabled for all Chromium users. Furthermore, their impact on Electron as a whole has likely not been tested.

Legitimate use cases exist, but unless you know what you are doing, you should not enable this property.

### 怎么做？

```js
// 不推荐
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  webPreferences: {
    experimentalFeatures: true
  }
})
```

```js
// 推荐
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({})
```

## 9) Do Not Use `enableBlinkFeatures`

*Electron的默认值即是建议值。*

Blink is the name of the rendering engine behind Chromium. As with `experimentalFeatures`, the `enableBlinkFeatures` property allows developers to enable features that have been disabled by default.

### 为什么？

Generally speaking, there are likely good reasons if a feature was not enabled by default. Legitimate use cases for enabling specific features exist. As a developer, you should know exactly why you need to enable a feature, what the ramifications are, and how it impacts the security of your application. Under no circumstances should you enable features speculatively.

### 怎么做？

```js
// 不推荐
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  webPreferences: {
    enableBlinkFeatures: ['ExecCommandInJavaScript']
  }
})
```

```js
// 推荐
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow()
```

## 10) Do Not Use `allowpopups`

*Electron的默认值即是建议值。*

If you are using [`<webview>`](../api/webview-tag.md), you might need the pages and scripts loaded in your `<webview>` tag to open new windows. The `allowpopups` attribute enables them to create new [`BrowserWindows`](../api/browser-window.md) using the `window.open()` method. `<webview>` tags are otherwise not allowed to create new windows.

### 为什么？

If you do not need popups, you are better off not allowing the creation of new [`BrowserWindows`](../api/browser-window.md) by default. This follows the principle of minimally required access: Don't let a website create new popups unless you know it needs that feature.

### 怎么做？

```html
<!-- 不推荐 -->
<webview allowpopups src="page.html"></webview>

<!-- 推荐 -->
<webview src="page.html"></webview>
```

## 11) Verify WebView Options Before Creation

A WebView created in a renderer process that does not have Node.js integration enabled will not be able to enable integration itself. However, a WebView will always create an independent renderer process with its own `webPreferences`.

It is a good idea to control the creation of new [`<webview>`](../api/webview-tag.md) tags from the main process and to verify that their webPreferences do not disable security features.

### 为什么？

Since `<webview>` live in the DOM, they can be created by a script running on your website even if Node.js integration is otherwise disabled.

Electron enables developers to disable various security features that control a renderer process. In most cases, developers do not need to disable any of those features - and you should therefore not allow different configurations for newly created [`<webview>`](../api/webview-tag.md) tags.

### 怎么做？

Before a [`<webview>`](../api/webview-tag.md) tag is attached, Electron will fire the `will-attach-webview` event on the hosting `webContents`. Use the event to prevent the creation of `webViews` with possibly insecure options.

```js
app.on('web-contents-created', (event, contents) => {
  contents.on('will-attach-webview', (event, webPreferences, params) => {
    // Strip away preload scripts if unused or verify their location is legitimate
    delete webPreferences.preload
    delete webPreferences.preloadURL

    // Disable Node.js integration
    webPreferences.nodeIntegration = false

    // Verify URL being loaded
    if (!params.src.startsWith('https://example.com/')) {
      event.preventDefault()
    }
  })
})
```

Again, this list merely minimizes the risk, it does not remove it. If your goal is to display a website, a browser will be a more secure option.

## 12) Disable or limit navigation

If your app has no need to navigate or only needs to navigate to known pages, it is a good idea to limit navigation outright to that known scope, disallowing any other kinds of navigation.

### 为什么？

Navigation is a common attack vector. If an attacker can convince your app to navigate away from its current page, they can possibly force your app to open web sites on the Internet. Even if your `webContents` are configured to be more secure (like having `nodeIntegration` disabled or `contextIsolation` enabled), getting your app to open a random web site will make the work of exploiting your app a lot easier.

A common attack pattern is that the attacker convinces your app's users to interact with the app in such a way that it navigates to one of the attacker's pages. This is usually done via links, plugins, or other user-generated content.

### 怎么做？

If your app has no need for navigation, you can call `event.preventDefault()` in a [`will-navigate`](../api/web-contents.md#event-will-navigate) handler. If you know which pages your app might navigate to, check the URL in the event handler and only let navigation occur if it matches the URLs you're expecting.

We recommend that you use Node's parser for URLs. Simple string comparisons can sometimes be fooled - a `startsWith('https://example.com')` test would let `https://example.com.attacker.com` through.

```js
const URL = require('url').URL

app.on('web-contents-created', (event, contents) => {
  contents.on('will-navigate', (event, navigationUrl) => {
    const parsedUrl = new URL(navigationUrl)

    if (parsedUrl.origin !== 'https://example.com') {
      event.preventDefault()
    }
  })
})
```

## 13) Disable or limit creation of new windows

If you have a known set of windows, it's a good idea to limit the creation of additional windows in your app.

### 为什么？

Much like navigation, the creation of new `webContents` is a common attack vector. Attackers attempt to convince your app to create new windows, frames, or other renderer processes with more privileges than they had before; or with pages opened that they couldn't open before.

If you have no need to create windows in addition to the ones you know you'll need to create, disabling the creation buys you a little bit of extra security at no cost. This is commonly the case for apps that open one `BrowserWindow` and do not need to open an arbitrary number of additional windows at runtime.

### 怎么做？

[`webContents`](../api/web-contents.md) will emit the [`new-window`](../api/web-contents.md#event-new-window) event before creating new windows. That event will be passed, amongst other parameters, the `url` the window was requested to open and the options used to create it. We recommend that you use the event to scrutinize the creation of windows, limiting it to only what you need.

```js
const { shell } = require('electron')

app.on('web-contents-created', (event, contents) => {
  contents.on('new-window', (event, navigationUrl) => {
    // In this example, we'll ask the operating system
    // to open this event's url in the default browser.
    event.preventDefault()

    shell.openExternalSync(navigationUrl)
  })
})
```

## 14) Do not use `openExternal` with untrusted content

Shell's [`openExternal`](../api/shell.md#shellopenexternalurl-options-callback) allows opening a given protocol URI with the desktop's native utilities. On macOS, for instance, this function is similar to the `open` terminal command utility and will open the specific application based on the URI and filetype association.

### 为什么？

Improper use of [`openExternal`](../api/shell.md#shellopenexternalurl-options-callback) can be leveraged to compromise the user's host. When openExternal is used with untrusted content, it can be leveraged to execute arbitrary commands.

### 怎么做？

```js
//  Bad
const { shell } = require('electron')
shell.openExternal(USER_CONTROLLED_DATA_HERE)
```

```js
//  Good
const { shell } = require('electron')
shell.openExternal('https://example.com/index.html')
```
