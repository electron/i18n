# 术语表

这篇文档说明了一些经常在 Electron 开发中使用的专业术语。

### ASAR

ASAR 代表了 Atom Shell Archive Format。 一个 [asar](https://github.com/electron/asar) 压缩包就是一个简单的 `tar` 文件-就像将那些有联系的文件格式化至一个单独的文件中。 Electron 能够任意读取其中的文件并且不需要解压缩整个文件。

ASAR 格式主要是为了提升 Windows 平台上的性能。TODO

### Brightray

Brightray 是一个可以让 [libchromiumcontent](#libchromiumcontent) 在应用中简易使用的静态库。 It is now deprecated and has been merged into Electron's codebase.

### CRT

C 运行时库 (CRT) 是包含了 ISO C99 标准库的 c + + 标准库的一部分。 执行 CRT 的 Visual c + + 库支持本机代码开发和混合本机代码和托管代码和纯托管的代码为.NET 开发。

### DMG

是指在 macOS 上使用的苹果系统的磁盘镜像打包格式。 DMG 文件通常被用来分发应用的 "installers"（安装包）。 [electron-builder ](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)支持使用 `dmg` 来作为编译目标。

### IME

Input Method Editor. A program that allows users to enter characters and symbols not found on their keyboard. For example, this allows users of Latin keyboards to input Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Indic characters.

### IPC

IPC stands for Inter-Process Communication. Electron uses IPC to send serialized JSON messages between the [main](#main-process) and [renderer](#renderer-process) processes.

### libchromiumcontent

A shared library that includes the [Chromium Content module](https://www.chromium.org/developers/content-module) and all its dependencies (e.g., Blink, [V8](#v8), etc.). Also referred to as "libcc".

### main process

The main process, commonly a file named `main.js`, is the entry point to every Electron app. It controls the life of the app, from open to close. It also manages native elements such as the Menu, Menu Bar, Dock, Tray, etc. The main process is responsible for creating each new renderer process in the app. The full Node API is built in.

Every app's main process file is specified in the `main` property in `package.json`. This is how `electron .` knows what file to execute at startup.

See also: [process](#process), [renderer process](#renderer-process)

### MAS

Acronym for Apple's Mac App Store. For details on submitting your app to the MAS, see the [Mac App Store Submission Guide](tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide.md).

### native modules

Native modules (also called [addons](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) in Node.js) are modules written in C or C++ that can be loaded into Node.js or Electron using the require() function, and used just as if they were an ordinary Node.js module. They are used primarily to provide an interface between JavaScript running in Node.js and C/C++ libraries.

Native Node modules are supported by Electron, but since Electron is very likely to use a different V8 version from the Node binary installed in your system, you have to manually specify the location of Electron’s headers when building native modules.

See also [Using Native Node Modules](tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md).

### NSIS

Nullsoft Scriptable Install System is a script-driven Installer authoring tool for Microsoft Windows. It is released under a combination of free software licenses, and is a widely-used alternative to commercial proprietary products like InstallShield. [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) supports NSIS as a build target.

## OSR

Off-screen rendering.

### process

A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. Electron apps that make use of the [main](#main-process) and one or many [renderer](#renderer-process) process are actually running several programs simultaneously.

In Node.js and Electron, each running process has a `process` object. This object is a global that provides information about, and control over, the current process. As a global, it is always available to applications without using require().

See also: [main process](#main-process), [renderer process](#renderer-process)

### renderer process

The renderer process is a browser window in your app. Unlike the main process, there can be multiple of these and each is run in a separate process. They can also be hidden.

在常规的浏览器中, web 页面通常运行在一个叫沙盒的环境中，并不被允许访问原生资源。 Electron 的用户有能力使用 web 页面中的 Node.js APIs 进行低等级的操作系统交互。

### Squirrel

Squirrel is an open-source framework that enables Electron apps to update automatically as new versions are released. See the [autoUpdater](api/auto-updater.md) API for info about getting started with Squirrel.

### userland

This term originated in the Unix community, where "userland" or "userspace" referred to programs that run outside of the operating system kernel. More recently, the term has been popularized in the Node and npm community to distinguish between the features available in "Node core" versus packages published to the npm registry by the much larger "user" community.

Like Node, Electron is focused on having a small set of APIs that provide all the necessary primitives for developing multi-platform desktop applications. This design philosophy allows Electron to remain a flexible tool without being overly prescriptive about how it should be used. Userland enables users to create and share tools that provide additional functionality on top of what is available in "core".

### V8

V8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine. It is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

Electron builds V8 as part of Chromium and then points Node to that V8 when building it.

V8's version numbers always correspond to those of Google Chrome. Chrome 59 includes V8 5.9, Chrome 58 includes V8 5.8, etc.

### webview

`webview` tags are used to embed 'guest' content (such as external web pages) in your Electron app. They are similar to `iframe`s, but differ in that each webview runs in a separate process. It doesn't have the same permissions as your web page and all interactions between your app and embedded content will be asynchronous. This keeps your app safe from the embedded content.
