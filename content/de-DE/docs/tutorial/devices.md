# Device Access

Like Chromium based browsers, Electron provides access to device hardware through web APIs.  For the most part these APIs work like they do in a browser, but there are some differences that need to be taken into account.  The primary difference between Electron and browsers is what happens when device access is requested.  In a browser, users are presented with a popup where they can grant access to an individual device.  In Electron APIs are provided which can be used by a developer to either automatically pick a device or prompt users to pick a device via a developer created interface.

## Web Bluetooth API

The [Web Bluetooth API](https://web.dev/bluetooth/) can be used to communicate with bluetooth devices. In order to use this API in Electron, developers will need to handle the [`select-bluetooth-device` event on the webContents](../api/web-contents.md#event-select-bluetooth-device) associated with the device request.

### Beispiel

This example demonstrates an Electron application that automatically selects the first available bluetooth device when the `Test Bluetooth` button is clicked.

```

## WebHID API

The [WebHID API](https://web.dev/hid/) can be used to access HID devices such as keyboards and gamepads.  Electron provides several APIs for working with the WebHID API:

* The [`select-hid-device` event on the Session](../api/session.md#event-select-hid-device) can be used to select a HID device when a call to `navigator.hid.requestDevice` is made.  Additionally the [`hid-device-added`](../api/session.md#event-hid-device-added) and [`hid-device-removed`](../api/session.md#event-hid-device-removed) events on the Session can be used to handle devices being plugged in or unplugged during the `navigator.hid.requestDevice` process.
* [`ses.setDevicePermissionHandler(handler)`](../api/session.md#sessetdevicepermissionhandlerhandler) can be used to provide default permissioning to devices without first calling for permission to devices via `navigator.hid.requestDevice`.  Additionally, the default behavior of Electron is to store granted device permision through the lifetime of the corresponding WebContents.  If longer term storage is needed, a developer can store granted device permissions (eg when handling the `select-hid-device` event) and then read from that storage with `setDevicePermissionHandler`.
* [`ses.setPermissionCheckHandler(handler)`](../api/session.md#sessetpermissioncheckhandlerhandler) can be used to disable HID access for specific origins.

### Blocklist

By default Electron employs the same [blocklist](https://github.com/WICG/webhid/blob/main/blocklist.txt) used by Chromium.  If you wish to override this behavior, you can do so by setting the `disable-hid-blocklist` flag:

```javascript
app.commandLine.appendSwitch('disable-hid-blocklist')
```

### Beispiel

This example demonstrates an Electron application that automatically selects HID devices through [`ses.setDevicePermissionHandler(handler)`](../api/session.md#sessetdevicepermissionhandlerhandler) and through [`select-hid-device` event on the Session](../api/session.md#event-select-hid-device) when the `Test WebHID` button is clicked.

```javascript fiddle='docs/fiddles/features/web-hid'

```

## Web Serial API

The [Web Serial API](https://web.dev/serial/) can be used to access serial devices that are connected via serial port, USB, or Bluetooth.  In order to use this API in Electron, developers will need to handle the [`select-serial-port` event on the Session](../api/session.md#event-select-serial-port) associated with the serial port request.

There are several additional APIs for working with the Web Serial API:

* The [`serial-port-added`](../api/session.md#event-serial-port-added) and [`serial-port-removed`](../api/session.md#event-serial-port-removed) events on the Session can be used to handle devices being plugged in or unplugged during the `navigator.serial.requestPort` process.
* [`ses.setPermissionCheckHandler(handler)`](../api/session.md#sessetpermissioncheckhandlerhandler) can be used to disable serial access for specific origins.

### Beispiel

This example demonstrates an Electron application that automatically selects the first available Arduino Uno serial device (if connected) through [`select-serial-port` event on the Session](../api/session.md#event-select-serial-port) when the `Test Web Serial` button is clicked.

```javascript fiddle='docs/fiddles/features/web-serial'
