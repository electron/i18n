# Electron App Feedback Program
Electron is working on building a streamlined release process and having faster releases. To help with that, we have the App Feedback Program for large-scale Electron apps to test our beta releases and report app-specific issues to the Electron team. We use this program to help us prioritize work and get applications upgraded to the next stable release as soon as possible. There are a few requirements we expect from participants, such as attending short, online weekly check-ins. If you are interested or have questions, please send us a message at info@electronjs.org.
