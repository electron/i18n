# netLog

> Logging network events for a session.

Proses: [Main](../glossary.md#main-process)

```javascript
const { netLog } = require('electron')

app.on('ready', async function () {
  netLog.startLogging('/path/to/net-log')
  // After some network events
  const path = await netLog.stopLogging()
  console.log('Net-logs written to', path)
})
```

See [`--log-net-log`](chrome-command-line-switches.md#--log-net-logpath) to log network events throughout the app's lifecycle.

** Catatan: ** Semua metode kecuali yang ditentukan hanya dapat digunakan setelah event ` ready ` dari modul ` app ` dipancarkan.

## Methods

### `netLog.stopLogging([callback])`
