# Créer une nouvelle version d'Electron

Ce document décrit le processus pour créer une nouvelle version d’Electron.

## Set your tokens and environment variables

You'll need Electron S3 credentials in order to create and upload an Electron release. Contact a team member for more information.

There are a handful of `*_TOKEN` environment variables needed by the release scripts:

- `ELECTRON_GITHUB_TOKEN`: Create this by visiting https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo
- `APPVEYOR_TOKEN`: Create a token from https://windows-ci.electronjs.org/api-token If you don't have an account, ask a team member to add you.
- `CIRCLE_TOKEN`: Create a token from "Personal API Tokens" at https://circleci.com/account/api
- `VSTS_TOKEN`: Create a Personal Access Token at https://github.visualstudio.com/_usersSettings/tokens or https://github.visualstudio.com/_details/security/tokens with the scope of `Build (read and execute)`.
- `ELECTRON_S3_BUCKET`:
- `ELECTRON_S3_ACCESS_KEY`:
- `ELECTRON_S3_SECRET_KEY`: If you don't have these, ask a team member to help you.

Once you've generated these tokens, put them in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file is gitignored, and will be loaded into the environment by the release scripts.

## Determine which branch to release from

- **If releasing beta,** run the scripts below from `master`.
- **If releasing a stable version,** run the scripts below from the branch you're stabilizing.

## Find out what version change is needed

Run `npm run prepare-release -- --notesOnly` to view auto generated release notes. The notes generated should help you determine if this is a major, minor, patch, or beta version change. Read the [Version Change Rules](../tutorial/electron-versioning.md#semver) for more information.

**NB:** If releasing from a branch, e.g. 1-8-x, check out the branch with `git checkout 1-8-x` rather than `git checkout -b remotes/origin/1-8-x`. The scripts need `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` to return a short name, e.g. no `remotes/origin/`

## Run the prepare-release script

The prepare release script will do the following: 1. Check if a release is already in process and if so it will halt. 2. Créer une branche release. 3. Bump the version number in several files. See [this bump commit](https://github.com/electron/electron/commit/78ec1b8f89b3886b856377a1756a51617bc33f5a) for an example. 4. Create a draft release on GitHub with auto-generated release notes. 5. Pousser vers la branche release. 6. Call the APIs to run the release builds.

Once you have determined which type of version change is needed, run the `prepare-release` script with arguments according to your need: - `[major|minor|patch|beta]` to increment one of the version numbers, or - `--stable` to indicate this is a stable version

Par exemple :

### Changement de version majeure

```sh
npm run prepare-release -- major
```

### Minor version change

```sh
npm run prepare-release -- minor
```

### Patch version change

```sh
npm run prepare-release -- patch --stable
```

### Changement de la version bêta

```sh
npm run prepare-release -- beta
```

### Promouvoir la beta vers la stable

```sh
npm run prepare-release -- --stable
```

Tip: You can test the new version number before running `prepare-release` with a dry run of the `bump-version` script with the same major/minor/patch/beta arguments, e.g.:

```sh
$ ./script/bump-version.py --bump minor --dry-run
```

## Attendre pendant la compilation :hourglass_flowing_sand:

The `prepare-release` script will trigger the builds via API calls. To monitor the build progress, see the following pages:

- [electron-release-mas-x64](https://github.visualstudio.com/electron/_build/index?context=allDefinitions&path=%5C&definitionId=19&_a=completed) for MAS builds.
- [electron-release-osx-x64](https://github.visualstudio.com/electron/_build/index?context=allDefinitions&path=%5C&definitionId=18&_a=completed) for OSX builds.
- [circleci.com/gh/electron/electron](https://circleci.com/gh/electron) for Linux builds.
- [windows-ci.electronjs.org/project/AppVeyor/electron-39ng6](https://windows-ci.electronjs.org/project/AppVeyor/electron-39ng6) for Windows 32-bit builds.
- [windows-ci.electronjs.org/project/AppVeyor/electron](https://windows-ci.electronjs.org/project/AppVeyor/electron) for Windows 64-bit builds.

## Compiler les notes de publication

Écrire une note de publication est un bon moyen de vous tenir occupé pendant que la compilation se fasse. Pour avoir un modèle, vous pouvez voir les publications existantes sur [la page des publications](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases).

Tips: - Each listed item should reference a PR on electron/electron, not an issue, nor a PR from another repo like libcc. - No need to use link markup when referencing PRs. Strings like `#123` will automatically be converted to links on github.com. - Pour voir la version de Chromium, V8 et Node dans chaque version d'Electron, voir [atom.io/download/electron/index.json](https://atom.io/download/electron/index.json).

### Versions patch

Pour une version `patch`, utilisez le format suivant :

```sh
## Bug Fixes

* Fixed a cross-platform thing. #123

### Linux

* Fixed a Linux thing. #123

### macOS

* Fixed a macOS thing. #123

### Windows

* Fixed a Windows thing. #1234
```

### Versions mineures

For a `minor` release, e.g. `1.8.0`, use this format:

```sh
## Upgrades

- Upgraded from Node `oldVersion` to `newVersion`. #123

## API Changes

* Changed a thing. #123

### Linux

* Changed a Linux thing. #123

### macOS

* Changed a macOS thing. #123

### Windows

* Changed a Windows thing. #123
```

### Principales releases

```sh
## Upgrades

- Upgraded from Chromium `oldVersion` to `newVersion`. #123
- Upgraded from Node `oldVersion` to `newVersion`. #123

## Breaking API changes

* Changed a thing. #123

### Linux

* Changed a Linux thing. #123

### macOS

* Changed a macOS thing. #123

### Windows

* Changed a Windows thing. #123

## Other Changes

- Some other change. #123
```

### Beta releases

Use the same formats as the ones suggested above, but add the following note at the beginning of the changelog:

```sh
**Note:** This is a beta release and most likely will have have some
instability and/or regressions.

Please file new issues for any bugs you find in it.

This release is published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron)
under the `beta` tag and can be installed via `npm install electron@beta`.
```

## Modifier le projet de communiqué

1. Visit [the releases page](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases) and you'll see a new draft release with placeholder release notes.
2. Modifiez la version et ajouter des notes de publication.
3. Cliquez sur 'Save draft'. **Ne pas cliquer sur 'Publish release'!**
4. Attendez que toutes les compilations sont passées avant de continuer.
5. In the branch, verify that the release's files have been created:

```sh
$ npm run release -- --validateRelease
```

Note, if you need to run `--validateRelease` more than once to check the assets, run it as above the first time, then `node ./script/release.js --validateRelease` for subsequent calls so that you don't have to rebuild each time you want to check the assets.

## Publier la release

Once the merge has finished successfully, run the `release` script via `npm run release` to finish the release process. This script will do the following: 1. Build the project to validate that the correct version number is being released. 2. Download the binaries and generate the node headers and the .lib linker used on Windows by node-gyp to build native modules. 3. Create and upload the SHASUMS files stored on S3 for the node files. 4. Créez et téléversez le fichier SHASUMS256.txt sauvegardé sur la release de Github. 5. Validate that all of the required files are present on GitHub and S3 and have the correct checksums as specified in the SHASUMS files. 6. Publish the release on GitHub

## Publier sur le npm

Before publishing to npm, you'll need to log into npm as Electron. Optionally, you may find [npmrc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npmrc) to be a useful way to keep Electron's profile side-by-side with your own:

```sh
$ sudo npm install -g npmrc
$ npmrc -c electron
Removing old .npmrc (default)
Activating .npmrc "electron"
```

The Electron account's credentials are kept by GitHub in a password manager. You'll also need to have access to an 2FA authenticator app with the appropriate OTP generator code to log in.

```sh
$ npm login
Username: electron-nightly
Password: <This can be found under NPM Electron Nightly on LastPass>
Email: (this IS public) electron@github.com
```

Publish the release to npm. Before running this you'll need to have set `ELECTRON_NPM_OTP` as an environment variable using a code from the aforementioned 2FA authenticator app.

```sh
$ npm whoami
electron-nightly
$ npm run publish-to-npm
```

After publishing, you can check the `latest` release:

```sh
$ npm dist-tag ls electron
```

If for some reason `npm run publish-to-npm` fails, you can tag the release manually:

```sh
$ npm dist-tag add electron@<version> <tag>
```

e.g.:

```sh
$ npm dist-tag add electron@2.0.0 latest
```

# Résolution de problème

## Rerun broken builds

If a release build fails for some reason, you can use `script/ci-release-build.js` to rerun a release build:

### Rerun all linux builds:

```sh
node script/ci-release-build.js --ci=CircleCI --ghRelease TARGET_BRANCH
(TARGET_BRANCH) is the branch you are releasing from.
```

### Rerun all macOS builds:

```sh
node script/ci-release-build.js --ci=VSTS --ghRelease TARGET_BRANCH
(TARGET_BRANCH) is the branch you are releasing from.
```

### Rerun all Windows builds:

```sh
node script/ci-release-build.js --ci=AppVeyor --ghRelease TARGET_BRANCH
(TARGET_BRANCH) is the branch you are releasing from.
```

Additionally you can pass a job name to the script to run an individual job, eg:

```sh
node script/ci-release-build.js --ci=AppVeyor --ghRelease --job=electron-x64 TARGET_BRANCH
```

## Fix missing binaries of a release manually

In the case of a corrupted release with broken CI machines, we might have to re-upload the binaries for an already published release.

The first step is to go to the [Releases](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases) page and delete the corrupted binaries with the `SHASUMS256.txt` checksum file.

Then manually create distributions for each platform and upload them:

```sh
# Checkout the version to re-upload.
git checkout vX.Y.Z

# Create release build
gn gen out/Release --args="import(\"//electron/build/args/release.gn\") $GN_EXTRA_ARGS"

# To compile for specific arch, instead set
gn gen out/Release-<TARGET_ARCH> --args='import(\"//electron/build/args/release.gn\") target_cpu = "[arm|x64|ia32]"'

# Build by running ninja with the electron target
ninja -C out/Release electron
ninja -C out/Release electron:dist_zip

# Explicitly allow overwriting a published release.
./script/upload.py --overwrite
```

Allowable values for [target_cpu](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/+/master/docs/reference.md#built_in-predefined-variables-target_cpu_the-desired-cpu-architecture-for-the-build-possible-values) and [target_os](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/+/master/docs/reference.md#built_in-predefined-variables-target_os_the-desired-operating-system-for-the-build-possible-values).

After re-uploading all distributions, publish again to upload the checksum file:

```sh
npm run release
```
