Electron is temporarily pausing major releases

---

## What's Happening?

Our [major release cadence schedule](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/12-week-cadence) moves in lockstep with that of Chromium, and the Chromium project has made the recent decision to [pause its releases](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/03/upcoming-chrome-releases.html) due to adjusted work schedules. This means that for the duration of Chromium's altered cadence, Electron will also temporarily pause new major releases.

We feel that our best choice is to follow in Chromium's footsteps, and so in the interim the Electron team will shift to full-time work on bugfixes, security, performance, and stability.

We want to ensure that both our maintainers and our consumers' wellbeing is prioritized during this time, so we welcome your feedback and look forward to returning to our regular release schedule.

Edit (2020-03-30): Electron 9 stable will target Chromium M83 and be released on May 19, 2020, in response to [Chromium's announcement](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2020/03/chrome-and-chrome-os-release-updates.html) of skipping the M82 stable date and adjusting the M83 stable date.
