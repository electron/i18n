## Class: Cookies

> Query and modify a session's cookies.

Process: [Main](../glossary.md#main-process)

Instances of the `Cookies` class are accessed by using `cookies` property of
a `Session`.

For example:

```javascript
const {session} = require('electron')

// Query all cookies.
session.defaultSession.cookies.get({}, (error, cookies) => {
  console.log(error, cookies)
})

// Query all cookies associated with a specific url.
session.defaultSession.cookies.get({url: 'http://www.github.com'}, (error, cookies) => {
  console.log(error, cookies)
})

// Set a cookie with the given cookie data;
// may overwrite equivalent cookies if they exist.
const cookie = {url: 'http://www.github.com', name: 'dummy_name', value: 'dummy'}
session.defaultSession.cookies.set(cookie, (error) => {
  if (error) console.error(error)
})
```
