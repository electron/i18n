# Build Instructions (Windows)

Follow the guidelines below for building Electron on Windows.

## Prerequisites

* Windows 10 / Server 2012 R2 or higher
* Visual Studio 2017 15.7.2 or higher - [download VS 2019 Community Edition for
  free](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/)
  * See [the Chromium build documentation](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/windows_build_instructions.md#visual-studio) for more details on which Visual Studio
  components are required.
  * If your Visual Studio is installed in a directory other than the default, you'll need to
  set a few environment variables to point the toolchains to your installation path.
    * `vs2019_install = DRIVE:\path\to\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community`
       (replace `2019` and `Community` with your installed versions)
    * `WINDOWSSDKDIR = DRIVE:\path\to\Windows Kits\10`
* [Python 2.7.10 or higher](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
  * Contrary to the `depot_tools` setup instructions linked below, you will need
  to use your locally installed Python with at least version 2.7.10 (with
  support for TLS 1.2). To do so, make sure that in **PATH**, your locally
  installed Python comes before the `depot_tools` folder. Right now
  `depot_tools` still comes with Python 2.7.6, which will cause the `gclient`
  command to fail (see https://crbug.com/868864).
  * [Python for Windows (pywin32) Extensions](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/#files)
  is also needed in order to run the build process.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com)
* Debugging Tools for Windows of Windows SDK 10.0.15063.468 if you plan on
creating a full distribution since `symstore.exe` is used for creating a symbol
store from `.pdb` files.
  * Different versions of the SDK can be installed side by side. To install the
  SDK, open Visual Studio Installer, select
  `Change` → `Individual Components`, scroll down and select the appropriate
  Windows SDK to install. Another option would be to look at the
  [Windows SDK and emulator archive](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive)
  and download the standalone version of the SDK respectively.
  * The SDK Debugging Tools must also be installed. If the Windows 10 SDK was installed
  via the Visual Studio installer, then they can be installed by going to:
  `Control Panel` → `Programs` → `Programs and Features` → Select the "Windows Software Development Kit" →
  `Change` → `Change` → Check "Debugging Tools For Windows" → `Change`.
  Or, you can download the standalone SDK installer and use it to install the Debugging Tools.

If you don't currently have a Windows installation,
[dev.microsoftedge.com](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/)
has timebombed versions of Windows that you can use to build Electron.

Building Electron is done entirely with command-line scripts and cannot be done
with Visual Studio. You can develop Electron with any editor but support for
building with Visual Studio will come in the future.

**Note:** Even though Visual Studio is not used for building, it's still
**required** because we need the build toolchains it provides.

## Building

See [Build Instructions: GN](build-instructions-gn.md)

## 32bit Build

To build for the 32bit target, you need to pass `target_cpu = "x86"` as a GN
arg. You can build the 32bit target alongside the 64bit target by using a
different output directory for GN, e.g. `out/Release-x86`, with different
arguments.

```powershell
$ gn gen out/Release-x86 --args="import(\"//electron/build/args/release.gn\") target_cpu=\"x86\""
```

The other building steps are exactly the same.

## Visual Studio project

To generate a Visual Studio project, you can pass the `--ide=vs2017` parameter
to `gn gen`:

```powershell
$ gn gen out/Testing --ide=vs2017
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command xxxx not found

If you encountered an error like `Command xxxx not found`, you may try to use
the `VS2015 Command Prompt` console to execute the build scripts.

### Fatal internal compiler error: C1001

Make sure you have the latest Visual Studio update installed.

### LNK1181: cannot open input file 'kernel32.lib'

Try reinstalling 32bit Node.js.

### Error: ENOENT, stat 'C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\npm'

Creating that directory [should fix the problem](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25095327/102704):

```powershell
$ mkdir ~\AppData\Roaming\npm
```

### node-gyp is not recognized as an internal or external command

You may get this error if you are using Git Bash for building, you should use
PowerShell or VS2015 Command Prompt instead.

### cannot create directory at '...': Filename too long

node.js has some [extremely long pathnames](https://github.com/electron/node/tree/electron/deps/npm/node_modules/libnpx/node_modules/yargs/node_modules/read-pkg-up/node_modules/read-pkg/node_modules/load-json-file/node_modules/parse-json/node_modules/error-ex/node_modules/is-arrayish), and by default git on windows doesn't handle long pathnames correctly (even though windows supports them). This should fix it:

```sh
$ git config --system core.longpaths true
```

### error: use of undeclared identifier 'DefaultDelegateCheckMode'

This can happen during build, when Debugging Tools for Windows has been installed with Windows Driver Kit. Uninstall Windows Driver Kit and install Debugging Tools with steps described above.

### ImportError: No module named win32file

Make sure you have installed `pywin32` with `pip install pywin32`.

### Build Scripts Hang Until Keypress

This bug is a "feature" of Windows' command prompt. It happens when clicking inside the prompt window with
`QuickEdit` enabled and is intended to allow selecting and copying output text easily.
Since each accidental click will pause the build process, you might want to disable this
feature in the command prompt properties.
