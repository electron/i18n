Here are the new Electron apps that were added to the site in August.

The site is updated with new [apps](https://electronjs.org/apps) and [meetups](https://electronjs.org/community) through [pull requests](https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org/pulls) from the community. You can [watch the repository](https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org) to get notifications of new additions or if you're not interested in _all_ of the site's changes, subscribe to the [blog RSS feed](https://electronjs.org/feed.xml).

If you've made an Electron app or host a meetup, make a [pull request](https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org) to add it to the site and it will make the next roundup.
