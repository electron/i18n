Beginning in Electron 11, Electron will be shipping separate versions of Electron for Intel Macs (x64) and Apple's upcoming M1 hardware (arm64). You can learn more about how to get your Electron app [running on Apple's M1 hardware here.](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/apple-silicon) [#24545](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24545)
* Added V8 crash message and location information to crashReport parameters. [#24771](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24771)
* Improved the performance of sending wide objects over the context bridge. [#24671](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24671)

See the [11.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases/tag/v11.0.0) for a full list of new features and changes.

## Breaking Changes

* Removed experimental APIs: `BrowserView.{fromId, fromWebContents, getAllViews}` and the `id` property of `BrowserView`. [#23578](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/23578) 

More information about these and future changes can be found on the [Planned Breaking Changes](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/breaking-changes.md) page.

## API Changes

* Added `app.getApplicationInfoForProtocol()` API that returns detailed information about the app that handles a certain protocol. [#24112](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24112) 
* Added `app.createThumbnailFromPath()` API that returns a preview image of a file given its file path and a maximum thumbnail size. [#24802](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24802) 
* Added `webContents.forcefullyCrashRenderer()` to forcefully terminate a renderer process to assist with recovering a hung renderer. [#25756](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/25756)

## End of Support for 8.x.y

Electron 8.x.y has reached end-of-support as per the project's [support policy](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#supported-versions). Developers and applications are encouraged to upgrade to a newer version of Electron.

## What's Next

In the short term, you can expect the team to continue to focus on keeping up with the development of the major components that make up Electron, including Chromium, Node, and V8. Although we are careful not to make promises about release dates, our plan is to release new major versions of Electron with new versions of those components approximately quarterly. The [tentative 12.0.0 schedule](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/electron-timelines) maps out key dates in the Electron 12.0 development life cycle. Also, [see our versioning document](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/electron-versioning) for more detailed information about versioning in Electron.

For information on planned breaking changes in upcoming versions of Electron, [see our Planned Breaking Changes doc](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/breaking-changes.md).

### Continued Work for Deprecation of `remote` Module
We started work to remove the `remote` module in [Electron 9](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-9-0). We plan to remove the `remote` module itself in Electron 14. 

Read and follow [this issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21408) for full plans and details for deprecation.

### Final Step for Requiring Native Node Modules to be Context Aware or N-API (in Electron 12)
From Electron 6 onwards, we've been laying the groundwork to require [native Node modules](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) loaded in the renderer process to be either [N-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) or [Context Aware](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html#addons_context_aware_addons). Enforcing this change allows for stronger security, faster performance, and reduced maintenance workload. The final step of this plan is to remove the ability to disable render process reuse in Electron 12. 

Read and follow [this issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/18397) for full details, including the proposed timeline.
