app.description: ควบคุมวงรอบชีวิตของแอป
app.methods.quit.description: >-
  Try to close all windows. The before-quit event will be emitted first. If all windows are successfully closed, the will-quit event will be emitted and by default the application will terminate. This method guarantees that all beforeunload and unload event handlers are correctly executed. It is possible that a window cancels the quitting by returning false in the beforeunload event handler.
app.methods.exit.description: >-
  Exits immediately with exitCode.  exitCode defaults to 0. All windows will be closed immediately without asking user and the before-quit and will-quit events will not be emitted.
app.methods.relaunch.description: >-
  Relaunches the app when current instance exits. By default the new instance will use the same working directory and command line arguments with current instance. When args is specified, the args will be passed as command line arguments instead. When execPath is specified, the execPath will be executed for relaunch instead of current app. Note that this method does not quit the app when executed, you have to call app.quit or app.exit after calling app.relaunch to make the app restart. When app.relaunch is called for multiple times, multiple instances will be started after current instance exited. An example of restarting current instance immediately and adding a new command line argument to the new instance:
app.methods.isReady.returns.description: 'true if Electron has finished initializing, false otherwise.'
app.methods.focus.description: >-

app.methods.setPath.description: >-
  Overrides the path to a special directory or file associated with name. If the path specifies a directory that does not exist, the directory will be created by this method. On failure an Error is thrown. You can only override paths of a name defined in app.getPath. By default, web pages' cookies and caches will be stored under the userData directory. If you want to change this location, you have to override the userData path before the ready event of the app module is emitted.
app.methods.getVersion.returns.description: >-
  The version of the loaded application. If no version is found in the application's package.json file, the version of the current bundle or executable is returned.

app.methods.setAsDefaultProtocolClient.description: >-
  This method sets the current executable as the default handler for a protocol (aka URI scheme). It allows you to integrate your app deeper into the operating system. Once registered, all links with your-protocol:// will be opened with the current executable. The whole link, including protocol, will be passed to your application as a parameter. On Windows you can provide optional parameters path, the path to your executable, and args, an array of arguments to be passed to your executable when it launches. Note: On macOS, you can only register protocols that have been added to your app's info.plist, which can not be modified at runtime. You can however change the file with a simple text editor or script during build time. Please refer to Apple's documentation for details. The API uses the Windows Registry and LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme internally.
app.methods.setAsDefaultProtocolClient.parameters.protocol.description: >-

app.methods.removeAsDefaultProtocolClient.parameters.path.description: Defaults to `process.execPath`
app.methods.removeAsDefaultProtocolClient.parameters.args.description: Defaults to an empty array
app.methods.removeAsDefaultProtocolClient.returns.description: Whether the call succeeded.
app.methods.isDefaultProtocolClient.description: >-
  This method checks if the current executable is the default handler for a protocol (aka URI scheme). If so, it will return true. Otherwise, it will return false. Note: On macOS, you can use this method to check if the app has been registered as the default protocol handler for a protocol. You can also verify this by checking ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist on the macOS machine. Please refer to Apple's documentation for details. The API uses the Windows Registry and LSCopyDefaultHandlerForURLScheme internally.
app.methods.isDefaultProtocolClient.parameters.protocol.description: 'The name of your protocol, without `://`.'
app.methods.isDefaultProtocolClient.parameters.path.description: Defaults to `process.execPath`
app.methods.isDefaultProtocolClient.parameters.args.description: Defaults to an empty array
app.methods.setUserTasks.description: >-
  Adds tasks to the Tasks category of the JumpList on Windows. tasks is an array of Task objects. Note: If you'd like to customize the Jump List even more use app.setJumpList(categories) instead.

app.methods.setUserTasks.returns.description: Whether the call succeeded.
app.methods.getJumpListSettings.returns.properties.0.description: >-
  The minimum number of items that will be shown in the Jump List (for a more detailed description of this value see the ).
app.methods.getJumpListSettings.returns.properties.1.description: >-
  Array of JumpListItem objects that correspond to items that the user has explicitly removed from custom categories in the Jump List. These items must not be re-added to the Jump List in the call to app.setJumpList(), Windows will not display any custom category that contains any of the removed items.
app.methods.setJumpList.description: >-
  Sets or removes a custom Jump List for the application, and returns one of the following strings: If categories is null the previously set custom Jump List (if any) will be replaced by the standard Jump List for the app (managed by Windows). Note: If a JumpListCategory object has neither the type nor the name property set then its type is assumed to be tasks. If the name property is set but the type property is omitted then the type is assumed to be custom. Note: Users can remove items from custom categories, and Windows will not allow a removed item to be added back into a custom category until after the next successful call to app.setJumpList(categories). Any attempt to re-add a removed item to a custom category earlier than that will result in the entire custom category being omitted from the Jump List. The list of removed items can be obtained using app.getJumpListSettings(). Here's a very simple example of creating a custom Jump List:
app.methods.setJumpList.parameters.categories.description: or `null` Array of `JumpListCategory` objects.
app.methods.makeSingleInstance.description: >-
  This method makes your application a Single Instance Application - instead of allowing multiple instances of your app to run, this will ensure that only a single instance of your app is running, and other instances signal this instance and exit. callback will be called with callback(argv, workingDirectory) when a second instance has been executed. argv is an Array of the second instance's command line arguments, and workingDirectory is its current working directory. Usually applications respond to this by making their primary window focused and non-minimized. The callback is guaranteed to be executed after the ready event of app gets emitted. This method returns false if your process is the primary instance of the application and your app should continue loading. And returns true if your process has sent its parameters to another instance, and you should immediately quit. On macOS the system enforces single instance automatically when users try to open a second instance of your app in Finder, and the open-file and open-url events will be emitted for that. However when users start your app in command line the system's single instance mechanism will be bypassed and you have to use this method to ensure single instance. An example of activating the window of primary instance when a second instance starts:
app.methods.makeSingleInstance.parameters.callback.parameters.argv.description: An array of the second instance's command line arguments
app.methods.makeSingleInstance.parameters.callback.parameters.workingDirectory.description: The second instance's working directory

app.events.will-finish-launching.description: >-
  Emitted when the application has finished basic startup. On Windows and Linux, the will-finish-launching event is the same as the ready event; on macOS, this event represents the applicationWillFinishLaunching notification of NSApplication. You would usually set up listeners for the open-file and open-url events here, and start the crash reporter and auto updater. In most cases, you should just do everything in the ready event handler.
app.events.ready.description: >-
  Emitted when Electron has finished initializing. On macOS, launchInfo holds the userInfo of the NSUserNotification that was used to open the application, if it was launched from Notification Center. You can call app.isReady() to check if this event has already fired.
app.events.window-all-closed.description: >-
  Emitted when all windows have been closed. If you do not subscribe to this event and all windows are closed, the default behavior is to quit the app; however, if you subscribe, you control whether the app quits or not. If the user pressed Cmd + Q, or the developer called app.quit(), Electron will first try to close all the windows and then emit the will-quit event, and in this case the window-all-closed event would not be emitted.
app.events.before-quit.description: >-
  Emitted before the application starts closing its windows. Calling event.preventDefault() will prevent the default behaviour, which is terminating the application. Note: If application quit was initiated by autoUpdater.quitAndInstall() then before-quit is emitted after emitting close event on all windows and closing them.
app.events.will-quit.description: >-
  Emitted when all windows have been closed and the application will quit. Calling event.preventDefault() will prevent the default behaviour, which is terminating the application.

app.events.open-file.description: >-
  Emitted when the user wants to open a file with the application. The open-file event is usually emitted when the application is already open and the OS wants to reuse the application to open the file. open-file is also emitted when a file is dropped onto the dock and the application is not yet running. Make sure to listen for the open-file event very early in your application startup to handle this case (even before the ready event is emitted). You should call event.preventDefault() if you want to handle this event. On Windows, you have to parse process.argv (in the main process) to get the filepath.
app.events.open-url.description: >-
  Emitted when the user wants to open a URL with the application. Your application's Info.plist file must define the url scheme within the CFBundleURLTypes key, and set NSPrincipalClass to AtomApplication. You should call event.preventDefault() if you want to handle this event.
app.events.activate.description: >-
  Emitted when the application is activated. Various actions can trigger this event, such as launching the application for the first time, attempting to re-launch the application when it's already running, or clicking on the application's dock or taskbar icon.
app.events.continue-activity.description: >-
  Emitted during Handoff when an activity from a different device wants to be resumed. You should call event.preventDefault() if you want to handle this event. A user activity can be continued only in an app that has the same developer Team ID as the activity's source app and that supports the activity's type. Supported activity types are specified in the app's Info.plist under the NSUserActivityTypes key.
app.events.continue-activity.returns.type.description: A string identifying the activity. Maps to .
app.events.continue-activity.returns.userInfo.description: Contains app-specific state stored by the activity on another device.

app.events.web-contents-created.description: Emitted when a new webContents is created.
app.events.certificate-error.description: >-
  Emitted when failed to verify the certificate for url, to trust the certificate you should prevent the default behavior with event.preventDefault() and call callback(true).
app.events.certificate-error.returns.error.description: The error code
app.events.certificate-error.returns.callback.parameters.isTrusted.description: Whether to consider the certificate as trusted
app.events.select-client-certificate.description: >-
  Emitted when a client certificate is requested. The url corresponds to the navigation entry requesting the client certificate and callback can be called with an entry filtered from the list. Using event.preventDefault() prevents the application from using the first certificate from the store.
app.events.login.description: >-
  Emitted when webContents wants to do basic auth. The default behavior is to cancel all authentications, to override this you should prevent the default behavior with event.preventDefault() and call callback(username, password) with the credentials.
app.events.gpu-process-crashed.description: Emitted when the gpu process crashes or is killed.
app.events.accessibility-support-changed.description: >-
  Emitted when Chrome's accessibility support changes. This event fires when assistive technologies, such as screen readers, are enabled or disabled. See https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/accessibility for more details.
app.events.accessibility-support-changed.returns.accessibilitySupportEnabled.description: '`true` when Chrome''s accessibility support is enabled, `false` otherwise.'

ClientRequest.instanceMethods.removeHeader.parameters.name.description: Specify an extra header name.
ClientRequest.instanceMethods.write.description: >-
  callback is essentially a dummy function introduced in the purpose of keeping similarity with the Node.js API. It is called asynchronously in the next tick after chunk content have been delivered to the Chromium networking layer. Contrary to the Node.js implementation, it is not guaranteed that chunk content have been flushed on the wire before callback is called. Adds a chunk of data to the request body. The first write operation may cause the request headers to be issued on the wire. After the first write operation, it is not allowed to add or remove a custom header.
ClientRequest.instanceMethods.write.parameters.chunk.description: >-
  A chunk of the request body's data. If it is a string, it is converted into a Buffer using the specified encoding.
ClientRequest.instanceMethods.write.parameters.encoding.description: Used to convert string chunks into Buffer objects. Defaults to 'utf-8'.

  Continues any deferred redirection request when the redirection mode is manual.
ClientRequest.instanceProperties.chunkedEncoding.description: >-
  A Boolean specifying whether the request will use HTTP chunked transfer encoding or not. Defaults to false. The property is readable and writable, however it can be set only before the first write operation as the HTTP headers are not yet put on the wire. Trying to set the chunkedEncoding property after the first write will throw an error. Using chunked encoding is strongly recommended if you need to send a large request body as data will be streamed in small chunks instead of being internally buffered inside Electron process memory.
ClientRequest.instanceEvents.response.returns.response.description: An object representing the HTTP response message.
ClientRequest.instanceEvents.login.description: >-
  Emitted when an authenticating proxy is asking for user credentials. The callback function is expected to be called back with user credentials: Providing empty credentials will cancel the request and report an authentication error on the response object:
ClientRequest.instanceEvents.finish.description: >-
  Emitted just after the last chunk of the request's data has been written into the request object.
ClientRequest.instanceEvents.abort.description: >-
  Emitted when the request is aborted. The abort event will not be fired if the request is already closed.
ClientRequest.instanceEvents.error.description: >-
  Emitted when the net module fails to issue a network request. Typically when the request object emits an error event, a close event will subsequently follow and no response object will be provided.
ClientRequest.instanceEvents.error.returns.error.description: an error object providing some information about the failure.
ClientRequest.instanceEvents.close.description: >-
  Emitted as the last event in the HTTP request-response transaction. The close event indicates that no more events will be emitted on either the request or response objects.
ClientRequest.instanceEvents.redirect.description: >-
  Emitted when there is redirection and the mode is manual. Calling request.followRedirect will continue with the redirection.

contentTracing.description: |-
  Collect tracing data from Chromium's content module for finding performance
  bottlenecks and slow operations.
contentTracing.methods.getCategories.description: >-
  Get a set of category groups. The category groups can change as new code paths are reached. Once all child processes have acknowledged the getCategories request the callback is invoked with an array of category groups.
contentTracing.methods.startRecording.description: >-
  Start recording on all processes. Recording begins immediately locally and asynchronously on child processes as soon as they receive the EnableRecording request. The callback will be called once all child processes have acknowledged the startRecording request. categoryFilter is a filter to control what category groups should be traced. A filter can have an optional - prefix to exclude category groups that contain a matching category. Having both included and excluded category patterns in the same list is not supported. Examples: traceOptions controls what kind of tracing is enabled, it is a comma-delimited list. Possible options are: The first 3 options are trace recording modes and hence mutually exclusive. If more than one trace recording modes appear in the traceOptions string, the last one takes precedence. If none of the trace recording modes are specified, recording mode is record-until-full. The trace option will first be reset to the default option (record_mode set to record-until-full, enable_sampling and enable_systrace set to false) before options parsed from traceOptions are applied on it.
contentTracing.methods.stopRecording.description: >-
  Stop recording on all processes. Child processes typically cache trace data and only rarely flush and send trace data back to the main process. This helps to minimize the runtime overhead of tracing since sending trace data over IPC can be an expensive operation. So, to end tracing, we must asynchronously ask all child processes to flush any pending trace data. Once all child processes have acknowledged the stopRecording request, callback will be called with a file that contains the traced data. Trace data will be written into resultFilePath if it is not empty or into a temporary file. The actual file path will be passed to callback if it's not null.
contentTracing.methods.startMonitoring.description: >-
  Start monitoring on all processes. Monitoring begins immediately locally and asynchronously on child processes as soon as they receive the startMonitoring request. Once all child processes have acknowledged the startMonitoring request the callback will be called.
contentTracing.methods.stopMonitoring.description: >-
  Stop monitoring on all processes. Once all child processes have acknowledged the stopMonitoring request the callback is called.
contentTracing.methods.captureMonitoringSnapshot.description: >-
  Get the current monitoring traced data. Child processes typically cache trace data and only rarely flush and send trace data back to the main process. This is because it may be an expensive operation to send the trace data over IPC and we would like to avoid unneeded runtime overhead from tracing. So, to end tracing, we must asynchronously ask all child processes to flush any pending trace data. Once all child processes have acknowledged the captureMonitoringSnapshot request the callback will be called with a file that contains the traced data.
contentTracing.methods.getTraceBufferUsage.description: >-
  Get the maximum usage across processes of trace buffer as a percentage of the full state. When the TraceBufferUsage value is determined the callback is called.

crashReporter.description: Submit crash reports to a remote server.
crashReporter.methods.start.description: >-
  You are required to call this method before using any other crashReporter APIs and in each process (main/renderer) from which you want to collect crash reports. You can pass different options to crashReporter.start when calling from different processes. Note Child processes created via the child_process module will not have access to the Electron modules. Therefore, to collect crash reports from them, use process.crashReporter.start instead. Pass the same options as above along with an additional one called crashesDirectory that should point to a directory to store the crash reports temporarily. You can test this out by calling process.crash() to crash the child process. Note: To collect crash reports from child process in Windows, you need to add this extra code as well. This will start the process that will monitor and send the crash reports. Replace submitURL, productName and crashesDirectory with appropriate values. Note: If you need send additional/updated extra parameters after your first call start you can call setExtraParameter on macOS or call start again with the new/updated extra parameters on Linux and Windows. Note: On macOS, Electron uses a new crashpad client for crash collection and reporting. If you want to enable crash reporting, initializing crashpad from the main process using crashReporter.start is required regardless of which process you want to collect crashes from. Once initialized this way, the crashpad handler collects crashes from all processes. You still have to call crashReporter.start from the renderer or child process, otherwise crashes from them will get reported without companyName, productName or any of the extra information.
crashReporter.methods.start.parameters.options.properties.submitURL.description: URL that crash reports will be sent to as POST.
crashReporter.methods.start.parameters.options.properties.productName.description: Defaults to app.getName().

protocol.description: Register a custom protocol and intercept existing protocol requests.
protocol.methods.registerStandardSchemes.description: >-
  A standard scheme adheres to what RFC 3986 calls generic URI syntax. For example http and https are standard schemes, while file is not. Registering a scheme as standard, will allow relative and absolute resources to be resolved correctly when served. Otherwise the scheme will behave like the file protocol, but without the ability to resolve relative URLs. For example when you load following page with custom protocol without registering it as standard scheme, the image will not be loaded because non-standard schemes can not recognize relative URLs: Registering a scheme as standard will allow access to files through the FileSystem API. Otherwise the renderer will throw a security error for the scheme. By default web storage apis (localStorage, sessionStorage, webSQL, indexedDB, cookies) are disabled for non standard schemes. So in general if you want to register a custom protocol to replace the http protocol, you have to register it as a standard scheme: Note: This method can only be used before the ready event of the app module gets emitted.
protocol.methods.registerStandardSchemes.parameters.schemes.description: Custom schemes to be registered as standard schemes.
protocol.methods.registerStandardSchemes.parameters.options.properties.secure.description: true to register the scheme as secure. Default false.
protocol.methods.registerServiceWorkerSchemes.parameters.schemes.description: Custom schemes to be registered to handle service workers.
protocol.methods.registerFileProtocol.description: >-
  Registers a protocol of scheme that will send the file as a response. The handler will be called with handler(request, callback) when a request is going to be created with scheme. completion will be called with completion(null) when scheme is successfully registered or completion(error) when failed. To handle the request, the callback should be called with either the file's path or an object that has a path property, e.g. callback(filePath) or callback({path: filePath}). When callback is called with nothing, a number, or an object that has an error property, the request will fail with the error number you specified. For the available error numbers you can use, please see the net error list. By default the scheme is treated like http:, which is parsed differently than protocols that follow the "generic URI syntax" like file:, so you probably want to call protocol.registerStandardSchemes to have your scheme treated as a standard scheme.
protocol.methods.registerBufferProtocol.description: >-
  Registers a protocol of scheme that will send a Buffer as a response. The usage is the same with registerFileProtocol, except that the callback should be called with either a Buffer object or an object that has the data, mimeType, and charset properties. Example:

protocol.methods.registerHttpProtocol.description: >-
  Registers a protocol of scheme that will send an HTTP request as a response. The usage is the same with registerFileProtocol, except that the callback should be called with a redirectRequest object that has the url, method, referrer, uploadData and session properties. By default the HTTP request will reuse the current session. If you want the request to have a different session you should set session to null. For POST requests the uploadData object must be provided.
