session.defaultSession.cookies.get({})
  .then((cookies) => {
    console.log(cookies)
  }).catch((error) => {
    console.log(error)
  })

// Query all cookies associated with a specific url.
session.defaultSession.cookies.get({ url: 'http://www.github.com' })
  .then((cookies) => {
    console.log(cookies)
  }).catch((error) => {
    console.log(error)
  })

// Set a cookie with the given cookie data;
// may overwrite equivalent cookies if they exist.
const cookie = { url: 'http://www.github.com', name: 'dummy_name', value: 'dummy' }
session.defaultSession.cookies.set(cookie)
  .then(() => {
    // success
  }, (error) => {
    console.error(error)
  })
```
