# Recent Documents (Windows & macOS)

## Overview

Windows and macOS provide access to a list of recent documents opened by
the application via JumpList or dock menu, respectively.

__JumpList:__

__Application dock menu:__

To add a file to recent documents, you need to use the
[app.addRecentDocument][addrecentdocument] API.

## Example

### Add an item to recent documents

Starting with a working application from the
[Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md), add the following lines to the
`main.js` file:

```javascript
const { app } = require('electron')

app.addRecentDocument('/Users/USERNAME/Desktop/work.type')
```

After launching the Electron application, right click the application icon.
You should see the item you just added. In this guide, the item is a Markdown
file located in the root of the project:

![Recent document](../images/recent-documents.png)

### Clear the list of recent documents

To clear the list of recent documents, you need to use
[app.clearRecentDocuments][clearrecentdocuments] API in the `main.js` file:

```javascript
const { app } = require('electron')

app.clearRecentDocuments()
```

## Additional information

### Windows Notes

To use this feature on Windows, your application has to be registered as
a handler of the file type of the document, otherwise the file won't appear
in JumpList even after you have added it. You can find everything
on registering your application in [Application Registration][app-registration].

When a user clicks a file from the JumpList, a new instance of your application
will be started with the path of the file added as a command line argument.

### macOS Notes

#### Add the Recent Documents list to the application menu

You can add menu items to access and clear recent documents by adding the
following code snippet to your menu template:

```json
{
  "submenu":[
    {
      "label":"Open Recent",
      "role":"recentdocuments",
      "submenu":[
        {
          "label":"Clear Recent",
          "role":"clearrecentdocuments"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

When a file is requested from the recent documents menu, the `open-file` event
of `app` module will be emitted for it.
