# REPL

Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) is a simple, interactive computer programming
environment that takes single user inputs (i.e. single expressions), evaluates
them, and returns the result to the user.

The `repl` module provides a REPL implementation that can be accessed using:

* Assuming you have `electron` or `electron-prebuilt` installed as a local
  project dependency:

  ```sh
  ./node_modules/.bin/electron --interactive
  ```

* Assuming you have `electron` or `electron-prebuilt` installed globally:

  ```sh
  electron --interactive
  ```

This only creates a REPL for the main process. You can use the Console
tab of the Dev Tools to get a REPL for the renderer processes.

**Note:** `electron --interactive` is not available on Windows.

More information can be found in the [Node.js REPL docs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/repl.html).
