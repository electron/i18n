# Electron App Feedback Program

Zespół Electron pracuje nad usprawnionym procesem budowania wersji oraz szybszym ich wydawaniem. To help with that, we have the App Feedback Program for large-scale Electron apps to test our beta releases and report app-specific issues to the Electron team. We use this program to help us prioritize work and get applications upgraded to the next stable release as soon as possible. There are a few requirements we expect from participants, such as attending short, online weekly check-ins. Please visit the [blog post](https://electronjs.org/blog/app-feedback-program) for details and sign-up.
