title: Electron 2.0.0

After more than four months of development, eight beta releases, and worldwide
testing from many apps' staged rollouts, the release of Electron 2.0.0 is now
available from [electronjs.org](https://electronjs.org/).

---

## Release Process

Starting with 2.0.0, Electron's releases will follow [semantic versioning](https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-2-semantic-boogaloo). This means the major version will bump more often and will usually be a major update to Chromium. Patch releases should be more stable because they will contain only high-priority bug fixes.

Electron 2.0.0 also represents an improvement to how Electron is stabilized before a major release. Several large scale Electron apps have included 2.0.0 betas in staged rollouts, providing the best feedback loop Electron's ever had for a beta series.

## Changes / New Features

 * Major bumps to several important parts of Electron's toolchain, including Chrome 61, Node 8.9.3, V8 6.1.534.41, GTK+ 3 on Linux, updated spellchecker, and Squirrel.
 * [In-app purchases](https://electronjs.org/blog/in-app-purchases)
   are now supported on MacOS. [#11292](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/11292)
