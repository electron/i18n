For the first time ever, Electron is excited to publicize our release schedule starting with v5.0.0. This is our first step in having a public, long-term timeline.

As mentioned in our v4.0.0 stable release [blog post](https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-4-0#whats-next), we are planning to release approximately quarterly to maintain closer cadence with Chromium releases. Chromium releases a new version very quickly -- every 6 weeks.

Take a look at progression in Electron versus Chromium side-by-side:

In the last half of 2018, our top priority was releasing faster and catching up closer to Chromium. We succeeded by sticking to a predetermined timeline. Electron 3.0.0 and 4.0.0 were released in a 2-3 month timeline for each release. We are optimistic about continuing that pace in releasing 5.0.0 and beyond. With a major Electron release approximately every quarter, we're now keeping pace with Chromium's release cadence. Getting ahead of Chromium stable release is always a goal for us and we are taking steps towards that.

We would love to promise future dates like [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) and [Chromium](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule) do, but we are not at that place _yet_. We are optimistic that we will reach a long-term timeline in the future.

With that in mind, we are taking first steps by publicly posting our release schedule for v5.0.0. You can find that [here](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/electron-timelines).
