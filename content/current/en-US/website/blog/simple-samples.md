We recently hosted an Electron hackathon at GitHub HQ for members of [Hackbright Academy](https://hackbrightacademy.com), a coding school for women founded in San Francisco. To help attendees get a head start on their projects, our own [Kevin Sawicki](https://github.com/kevinsawicki) created a few sample Electron applications.

---

If you're new to Electron development or haven't yet tried it out, these
sample applications are a great place to start. They are small, easy to read,
and the code is heavily commented to explain how everything works.

To get started, clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/electron/simple-samples
```

To run any of the apps below, change into the app's directory,
install dependencies, then start:

```sh
cd activity-monitor
npm install
npm start
```

## Activity Monitor

Shows a doughnut chart of the CPU system, user, and idle activity time.

## Hash

Shows the hash values of entered text using different algorithms.

## Mirror

Includes an optional rainbow filter effect that uses CSS animations.

## Prices

Shows the current price of oil, gold, and silver using the Yahoo Finance API.
