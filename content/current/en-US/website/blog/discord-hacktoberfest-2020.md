# Electron Community Discord Launch
Electron’s [Outreach Working Group](https://github.com/electron/governance/tree/master/wg-outreach) is excited to
announce the launch of our official community Discord server!

## Why a new Discord server?
In its early days as the backbone of the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/), community discussion on the Electron
framework occurred in a single channel in Atom’s Slack workspace. As time passed and the two projects were increasingly
decoupled, the relevance of the Atom workspace to the Electron project decreased, and maintainer participation in the
Slack channel declined in the same manner.

Up until now, we had still been redirecting our broader community to the Atom Slack workspace, even though we’ve
had many reports from folks who have had trouble receiving invitations, and few of our core maintainers were
frequenting the channel.

We’re setting up this shiny new server to be a central discussion hub for the community where you can get the latest
news on all things Electron.

## Get in here!
So far, the server’s membership consists of a few maintainers who have been working together to set it up, but we’re
so excited to chat with you all! Come ask for help, keep up to date with Electron releases, or just hang out with other
developers. We’ve got a handy [invite for you](https://discord.gg/H6uTh7m) that’ll give you access to the server!

# Hacktoberfest 2020
As a large and long-running open-source project, Electron wouldn’t have been nearly as successful without all the
contributions from its community, from code submissions to bug reports to documentation changes, and much more.
That’s why we believe in the importance of participating in Hacktoberfest to usher in a wider community of developers
of all skill levels into the project.

## Odds and ends
This year, we don’t have a wider project to give you all to work on, but we’d like to focus on opportunities to contribute
across the Electron JavaScript ecosystem.

Look out for issues tagged [`hacktoberfest`](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest+org%3Aelectron+org%3Aelectron-userland)
across our various repositories, including the main
[electron/electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22hacktoberfest%22+) repository,
the [electron/electronjs.org](https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22hacktoberfest%22+) website,
[electron/fiddle](https://github.com/electron/fiddle/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22hacktoberfest%22+),
and [electron-userland/electron-forge](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22hacktoberfest%22+)!

P.S. If you're feeling particularly adventurous, we also have a backlog of issues marked with
[`help wanted`](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+org%3Aelectron+org%3Aelectron-userland)
tags if you're looking for more of a challenge.

## Stuck? Come chat with us!
Moreover, it’s also no coincidence that the grand opening of our Discord server coincides with the largest celebration of
open-source software of the year. Check out the #hacktoberfest channel to ask for help on your Hacktoberfest PR. In case
you missed it, [here's the invite link again](https://discord.gg/H6uTh7m)!
