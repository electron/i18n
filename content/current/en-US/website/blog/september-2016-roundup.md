### New Talks

In September, GitHub held its GitHub Universe conference billed as the event for people building the future of software. There were a couple of interesting Electron talks at the event.

* [Making Electron Development Simpler, More Pleasant, and More Productive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqg_IqVeI5s) by Machist√© Quintana, a Software Engineer at Slack.
* [Electron: Desktop Apps with Web Languages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNHBfN8c32U) by Zeke Sikelianos, an Electron Developer at GitHub.

Also, if you happen to be in Paris on December 5, Zeke will be [giving an Electron talk at dotJS 2016](https://twitter.com/dotJS/status/783615732307333120).
