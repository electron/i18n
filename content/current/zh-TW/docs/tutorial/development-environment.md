# 開發環境

Electron development is essentially Node.js development. To turn your operating system into an environment capable of building desktop apps with Electron, you will merely need Node.js, npm, a code editor of your choice, and a rudimentary understanding of your operating system's command line client.

## macOS 設定

> Electron supports macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) and up. Apple does not allow running macOS in virtual machines unless the host computer is already an Apple computer, so if you find yourself in need of a Mac, consider using a cloud service that rents access to Macs (like [MacInCloud](https://www.macincloud.com/) or [xcloud](https://xcloud.me)).

首先，安裝最新版本的 Node.js。 We recommend that you install either the latest `LTS` or `Current` version available. Visit [the Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and select the `macOS Installer`. While Homebrew is an offered option, but we recommend against it - many tools will be incompatible with the way Homebrew installs Node.js.

Once downloaded, execute the installer and let the installation wizard guide you through the installation.

安裝後，確認一切按預期工作。 Find the macOS `Terminal` application in your `/Applications/Utilities` folder (or by searching for the word `Terminal` in Spotlight). Open up `Terminal` or another command line client of your choice and confirm that both `node` and `npm` are available:

```sh
# 這個指令應該會印出 Node.js 版本
node -v

# 這個指令應該會印出 npm 版本
npm -v
```

If both commands printed a version number, you are all set! Before you get started, you might want to install a [code editor](#a-good-editor) suited for JavaScript development.

## Windows 設定

> Electron supports Windows 7 and later versions – attempting to develop Electron applications on earlier versions of Windows will not work. Microsoft provides free [virtual machine images with Windows 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines) for developers.

首先，安裝最新版本的 Node.js。 We recommend that you install either the latest `LTS` or `Current` version available. Visit [the Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and select the `Windows Installer`. Once downloaded, execute the installer and let the installation wizard guide you through the installation.

On the screen that allows you to configure the installation, make sure to select the `Node.js runtime`, `npm package manager`, and `Add to PATH` options.

安裝後，確認一切按預期工作。 Find the Windows PowerShell by opening the Start Menu and typing `PowerShell`. Open up `PowerShell` or another command line client of your choice and confirm that both `node` and `npm` are available:

```powershell
# 這個指令應該會印出 Node.js 版本
node -v

# 這個指令應該會印出 npm 版本
npm -v
```

If both commands printed a version number, you are all set! Before you get started, you might want to install a [code editor](#a-good-editor) suited for JavaScript development.

## Linux設定

> Generally speaking, Electron supports Ubuntu 12.04, Fedora 21, Debian 8 and later.

首先，安裝最新版本的 Node.js。 Depending on your Linux distribution, the installation steps might differ. Assuming that you normally install software using a package manager like `apt` or `pacman`, use the official [Node.js guidance on installing on Linux](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

You're running Linux, so you likely already know how to operate a command line client. Open up your favorite client and confirm that both `node` and `npm` are available globally:

```sh
# 這個指令應該會印出 Node.js 版本
node -v

# 這個指令應該會印出 npm 版本
npm -v
```

If both commands printed a version number, you are all set! Before you get started, you might want to install a [code editor](#a-good-editor) suited for JavaScript development.

## 好的編輯器

我們推薦兩款熱門的編輯器來開發 Electron: GitHub 的 [Atom](https://atom.io/) 和微軟的 [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 他們兩者都有出色的JavaScript支援。

If you are one of the many developers with a strong preference, know that virtually all code editors and IDEs these days support JavaScript.
