Code signing is a security technology that you use to certify that an app was created by you.

On macOS the system can detect any change to the app, whether the change is introduced accidentally or by malicious code.

On Windows, the system assigns a trust level to your code signing certificate which if you don't have, or if your trust level is low, will cause security dialogs to appear when users start using your application.  Trust level builds over time so it's better to start code signing as early as possible.

While it is possible to distribute unsigned apps, it is not recommended. Both Windows and macOS will, by default, prevent either the download or the execution of unsigned applications. Starting with macOS Catalina (version 10.15), users have to go through multiple manual steps to open unsigned applications.

If you are building an Electron app that you intend to package and distribute, it should be code-signed.

# Signing & notarizing macOS builds

Properly preparing macOS applications for release requires two steps: First, the app needs to be code-signed. Then, the app needs to be uploaded to Apple for a process called "notarization", where automated systems will further verify that your app isn't doing anything to endanger its users.

To start the process, ensure that you fulfill the requirements for signing and notarizing your app:

1. Enroll in the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) (requires an annual fee)
2. Download and install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) - this requires a computer running macOS
3. Generate, download, and install [signing certificates](https://github.com/electron/electron-osx-sign/wiki/1.-Getting-Started#certificates)

Electron's ecosystem favors configuration and freedom, so there are multiple ways to get your application signed and notarized.

## `electron-forge`

If you're using Electron's favorite build tool, getting your application signed and notarized requires a few additions to your configuration. [Forge](https://electronforge.io) is a collection of the official Electron tools, using [`electron-packager`], [`electron-osx-sign`], and [`electron-notarize`] under the hood.

Let's take a look at an example configuration with all required fields. Not all of them are required: the tools will be clever enough to automatically find a suitable `identity`, for instance, but we recommend that you are explicit.

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "config": {
    "forge": {
      "packagerConfig": {
        "osxSign": {
          "identity": "Developer ID Application: Felix Rieseberg (LT94ZKYDCJ)",
          "hardened-runtime": true,
          "entitlements": "entitlements.plist",
          "entitlements-inherit": "entitlements.plist",
          "signature-flags": "library"
        },
        "osxNotarize": {
          "appleId": "felix@felix.fun",
          "appleIdPassword": "my-apple-id-password",
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `plist` file referenced here needs the following macOS-specific entitlements to assure the Apple security mechanisms that your app is doing these things without meaning any harm:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.debugger</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

To see all of this in action, check out Electron Fiddle's source code, [especially its `electron-forge` configuration file](https://github.com/electron/fiddle/blob/master/forge.config.js).


## `electron-builder`

Electron Builder comes with a custom solution for signing your application. You can find [its documentation here](https://www.electron.build/code-signing).

## `electron-packager`

If you're not using an integrated build pipeline like Forge or Builder, you are likely using [`electron-packager`], which includes [`electron-osx-sign`] and [`electron-notarize`].

If you're using Packager's API, you can pass [in configuration that both signs and notarizes your application](https://electron.github.io/electron-packager/master/interfaces/electronpackager.options.html).

```js
const packager = require('electron-packager')

packager({
  dir: '/path/to/my/app',
  osxSign: {
    identity: 'Developer ID Application: Felix Rieseberg (LT94ZKYDCJ)',
    'hardened-runtime': true,
    entitlements: 'entitlements.plist',
    'entitlements-inherit': 'entitlements.plist',
    'signature-flags': 'library'
  },
  osxNotarize: {
    appleId: 'felix@felix.fun',
    appleIdPassword: 'my-apple-id-password'
  }
})
```

The `plist` file referenced here needs the following macOS-specific entitlements to assure the Apple security mechanisms that your app is doing these things without meaning any harm:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.debugger</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

# Signing Windows builds

قبل التوقيع بناءات Windows، يجب عليك القيام بما يلي:

1. Get a Windows Authenticode code signing certificate (requires an annual fee)
2. Install Visual Studio to get the signing utility (the free [Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is enough)
