## Class: Cookies

> 查詢及修改 Session 的 Cookie 內容。

處理序: [主處理序](../glossary.md#main-process)

Instances of the `Cookies` class are accessed by using `cookies` property of a `Session`.

例如:

```javascript
const {session} = require('electron')

// 查詢所有 cookies。
session.defaultSession.cookies.get({}, (error, cookies) => {
  console.log(error, cookies)
})

// 查詢指定 url 的所有 cookie。
session.defaultSession.cookies.get({url: 'http://www.github.com'}, (error, cookies) => {
  console.log(error, cookies)
})

// 將 cookie 設成指定的資料; 可能會覆寫已經存在的對等 cookie。
const cookie = {url: 'http://www.github.com', name: 'dummy_name', value: 'dummy'}
session.defaultSession.cookies.set(cookie, (error) => {
  if (error) console.error(error)
})
```
