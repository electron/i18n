# 용어 사전

이 페이지는 Electron 개발에 흔히 사용되는 용어를 정의합니다.

### ASAR

ASAR는 Atom Shell Archive Format의 약자입니다. [asar](https://github.com/electron/asar) 아카이브는 `tar`과 비슷한 포맷으로, 모든 리소스를 단일 파일로 만듭니다. 그리고 Electron은 압축해제 없이 임의로 모든 파일을 읽어들일 수 있습니다.

ASAR 포맷은 Windows에서의 성능 향상을 목적으로 만들어졌습니다... [작성 중]

### Brightray

Brightray [was](https://github.com/electron-archive/brightray) a static library that made [libchromiumcontent](#libchromiumcontent) easier to use in applications. It is now deprecated and has been merged into Electron's codebase.

### CRT

The C Run-time Library (CRT) is the part of the C++ Standard Library that incorporates the ISO C99 standard library. The Visual C++ libraries that implement the CRT support native code development, and both mixed native and managed code, and pure managed code for .NET development.

### DMG

An Apple Disk Image is a packaging format used by macOS. DMG files are commonly used for distributing application "installers". [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) supports `dmg` as a build target.

### IME

Input Method Editor. A program that allows users to enter characters and symbols not found on their keyboard. For example, this allows users of Latin keyboards to input Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Indic characters.

### IPC

IPC stands for Inter-Process Communication. Electron uses IPC to send serialized JSON messages between the [main](#main-process) and [renderer](#renderer-process) processes.

### libchromiumcontent

A shared library that includes the [Chromium Content module](https://www.chromium.org/developers/content-module) and all its dependencies (e.g., Blink, [V8](#v8), etc.). Also referred to as "libcc".

### 메인 프로세스

The main process, commonly a file named `main.js`, is the entry point to every Electron app. It controls the life of the app, from open to close. It also manages native elements such as the Menu, Menu Bar, Dock, Tray, etc. The main process is responsible for creating each new renderer process in the app. The full Node API is built in.

Every app's main process file is specified in the `main` property in `package.json`. This is how `electron .` knows what file to execute at startup.

In Chromium, this process is referred to as the "browser process". It is renamed in Electron to avoid confusion with renderer processes.

### MAS

Acronym for Apple's Mac App Store. For details on submitting your app to the MAS, see the [Mac App Store Submission Guide](tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide.md).

### native modules

Native modules (also called [addons](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) in Node.js) are modules written in C or C++ that can be loaded into Node.js or Electron using the require() function, and used just as if they were an ordinary Node.js module. They are used primarily to provide an interface between JavaScript running in Node.js and C/C++ libraries.

Native Node modules are supported by Electron, but since Electron is very likely to use a different V8 version from the Node binary installed in your system, you have to manually specify the location of Electron’s headers when building native modules.

See also [Using Native Node Modules](tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md).

### NSIS

Nullsoft Scriptable Install System is a script-driven Installer authoring tool for Microsoft Windows. It is released under a combination of free software licenses, and is a widely-used alternative to commercial proprietary products like InstallShield. [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) supports NSIS as a build target.

### OSR

OSR (Off-screen rendering) can be used for loading heavy page in background and then displaying it after (it will be much faster). It allows you to render page without showing it on screen.

### process

A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. Electron apps that make use of the [main](#main-process) and one or many [renderer](#renderer-process) process are actually running several programs simultaneously.

In Node.js and Electron, each running process has a `process` object. This object is a global that provides information about, and control over, the current process. As a global, it is always available to applications without using require().

See also: [main process](#main-process), [renderer process](#renderer-process)

### renderer process

The renderer process is a browser window in your app. Unlike the main process, there can be multiple of these and each is run in a separate process. They can also be hidden.

일반적인 브라우저에서 웹 페이지는 대개 샌드박스 환경에서 실행하고 네이티브 리소스에 액세스 할 수 없습니다. 그러나 Electron 유저들은 Node.js APIs 의 낮은 수준의 운영체제 상호 작용을 허용하는 웹 페이지에서 힘이 있다.

### Squirrel

Squirrel은 Electron 앱에 새로운 버전이 적용되면 자동으로 업데이트할 수 있도록 하는 오픈 소스 프레임워크입니다. Squirrel로 시작하기 위해 [autoUpdater](api/auto-updater.md) API 에서 정보를 살펴보세요.

### 매뉴얼

This term originated in the Unix community, where "userland" or "userspace" referred to programs that run outside of the operating system kernel. More recently, the term has been popularized in the Node and npm community to distinguish between the features available in "Node core" versus packages published to the npm registry by the much larger "user" community.

Like Node, Electron is focused on having a small set of APIs that provide all the necessary primitives for developing multi-platform desktop applications. This design philosophy allows Electron to remain a flexible tool without being overly prescriptive about how it should be used. Userland enables users to create and share tools that provide additional functionality on top of what is available in "core".

### V8

V8은 Google의 오픈소스 자바스크립트 엔진입니다. 이것은 C++로 작성되었으며 구글 크롬에서 사용되고 있습니다. V8은 독립형으로 실행할 수 있으며 모든 C++ 응용프로그램에 임베디드 될 수 있습니다.

Electron builds V8 as part of Chromium and then points Node to that V8 when building it.

V8's version numbers always correspond to those of Google Chrome. Chrome 59 includes V8 5.9, Chrome 58 includes V8 5.8, etc.

### webview

`webview` tags are used to embed 'guest' content (such as external web pages) in your Electron app. They are similar to `iframe`s, but differ in that each webview runs in a separate process. It doesn't have the same permissions as your web page and all interactions between your app and embedded content will be asynchronous. This keeps your app safe from the embedded content.
