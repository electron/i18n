# powerMonitor

> Monitor power state changes.

이모듈을 이용 하시려면 `app`의`ready`이벤트가 방사돼기를 기다려야 합니다.

예시:

```javascript
const electron = require('electron')
const {app} = electron

app.on('ready', () => {
  electron.powerMonitor.on('suspend', () => {
    console.log('The system is going to sleep')
  })
})
```

## 이벤트

The `powerMonitor` module emits the following events:

### Event: 'suspend'

Emitted when the system is suspending.

### Event: 'resume'

Emitted when system is resuming.

### Event: 'on-ac' *Windows*

Emitted when the system changes to AC power.

### Event: 'on-battery' *Windows*

Emitted when system changes to battery power.

### Event: 'shutdown' *Linux* *macOS*

Emitted when the system is about to reboot or shut down. If the event handler invokes `e.preventDefault()`, Electron will attempt to delay system shutdown in order for the app to exit cleanly. If `e.preventDefault()` is called, the app should exit as soon as possible by calling something like `app.quit()`.
