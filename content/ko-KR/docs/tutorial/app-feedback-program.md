# Electron 앱 피드백 프로그램

일렉트론은 릴리스 과정을 간소화하여 더욱더 빠르게 릴리스 하는 데에 공을 들이고 있습니다. To help with that, we have the App Feedback Program for large-scale Electron apps to test our beta releases and report app-specific issues to the Electron team. We use this program to help us prioritize work and get applications upgraded to the next stable release as soon as possible. There are a few requirements we expect from participants, such as attending short, online weekly check-ins. If you are interested or have questions, please send us a message at info@electronjs.org.
